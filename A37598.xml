            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He faithfull Author hereof had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (as thou maiſt perceive by the enſuing Preface) to have added the Quotations, more exactly, and more at large, of thoſe Authors, which are made uſe of in the enſuing Treatiſe: but it is come to paſſe, by his departure out of this life unto the Lord, that that matter is not finiſhed. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moſt Quotations are ſet down, though not in ſo large a manner as was intended. Yet for a more full ſupply of that defect, I intreat thee, Christian Reader, to take notice of theſe two things: Firſt, that it falls out often in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Book, that one and the ſame paſſage of an Author is ſeverall times alleadged, upon divers occaſions; yet it may bee, the Authors name, and the place of his works, out of which it is taken, not quoted above once: In which caſe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192569:3"/> 
               <hi>by an eaſie obſervation, that which is expreſſed in one place may bee ſupplied unto all the reſt. Secondly, oftentimes the name of an Authour is ſet downe, but not the particular place, out of which the ſentence is cited. In which caſe ordinarily thou maiſt have recourſe to that Author named, in his Notes or Commentaries upon the place of Scripture immediately before urged: or if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours name be not ſet down, yet maiſt thou uſually finde him among thoſe collected by</hi> Marlorat. <hi>But that which fully recompenſeth all defect, is, that the Texts of Scripture (which only is able to make wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15.) <hi>are carefully, and conſiderately alleadged: For</hi> if we receive the witneſſe of man, the witneſſe of God is greater, 1 Joh. 5. 9. <hi>And indeed, the Testimonies of the Learned are not therefore urged, that our Faith ſhould bee built upon them, which were Idolatrie in a high degree, even a giving of the moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worſhip of God, to wit, Faith unto the Creature; and not to believe God upon his own word, without the atteſtation of ſalſe, and ſinfull man. But they are alleadged that they may bee helps to evidence, and apply unto us the word of God; in the evidence whereof alone, made to appeare unto us, by what helps ſoever, wee are to reſt: And to ſtop the mouths of thoſe who caſt an imputation of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity upon the truth of God; whereby many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> even from the examination of it. But unto thee (Chriſtian Reader) concerning this following diſcourſe, I have two, as it ſeemes to mee, very reaſonable requeſts. Firſt, that thou wouldſt paſſe no</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192569:3"/> 
               <hi>cenſure upon the Book or Author, 'till thou haſt fully and carefully examined it, by that un-erring Rule of Gods word; whereby thou canst not bee deceived, leſt thou fall into the number of thoſe that</hi> ſpeak evill of thoſe things which they know not, Jude 10. <hi>Secondly, that after thou haſt done ſo, thou wouldſt not ſuffer thy ſelfe to bee ſwayed from judging according to that Rule, by any reſpect whatſoever; and to that purpoſe, that thou wouldſt take for thine example, the Lord Ieſus, of whom it was propheſied, That</hi> hee ſhould not judge after the ſight of the eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of the eares, <hi>that is following ſenſe, reaſon, or any other corrupt humane principles of judging, But</hi> that with righteouſneſſe he ſhould judge the poore, and reprove with equitie, Eſay 11. 3. 4. <hi>Alwayes conſidering how dreadfull a thing it is, that the only Rock of Salvation, ſhould bee unto a man a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a Rock of offenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at hee ſhould ſtumble, and fall, and never riſe up again. As for the Author himſelfe, I had intended to have acquainted thee fully as well with his life, and converſation, as this Book doth with his Faith and Doctrine, whereunto all the opportunities faile at this time: yet I hope (God willing) to doe it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For indeed his faith, and zeale, and diligence in doing his calling, and his faith, patience, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in ſuffering for the ſame, were ſo exemplarie, that they are worthy to bee ſet forth as a pattern; not only to all Gods People and Miniſters now, but even to all ſucceeding generations.

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, becauſe the Dead Faith doth goe very farre in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and is very like the true, lively, juſtifying, and ſaving faith; yea as like the true ſaving faith, both in it ſelfe, and in reſembling all the actions of the true faith, as the ſhadow or image in a looking-glaſſe is like, doth reſemble, and imitate the ſubſtance or party that looketh into the glaſſe; becauſe the dead faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of theſe three parts, greatly reſembling the true ſaving faith. As firſt, ſuch as lie in the ſame may have great knowledge in the whole word and will of God, and may joyne therewith the reading of all the Doctors and Expoſitors in the Church: and alſo may be zealous Preachers of the ſame, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17. ſaying, <hi>Behold thou art called a Iew,</hi> that is, one of Gods choſen above all the Nations of the
<pb facs="tcp:192569:5"/> earth, <hi>and reſteſt in the Law,</hi> that is, ſtayeſt thy ſelfe only upon the doctrine delivered from heaven, <hi>and glorieſt in God,</hi> namely, that he is thy Saviour, and Redeemer, <hi>Pſal. 78. 35. and knoweſt his will, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveſt the things that are excellent, being inſtructed in the Law,</hi> or word or doctrine from heaven: Neither thus haſt thou knowledge for thy ſelfe only, <hi>but alſo art confident, that thou art a guide of the blinde, a light to them that are in darkneſſe,</hi> verſe 19. <hi>an Inſtructer of the fooliſh, a Teacher of the ignorant; having the whole forme of knowledge, and of the truth in the law, or word, &amp;c.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuch may think that they have a ſtrong faith in all Gods graces through Chriſt, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them as well and as truly, as any can doe: as it is expreſſed <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 17. ſaying, <hi>Thou ſayeſt, that thou art rich</hi> (namely, in the treaſures and benefits of the Goſpel) <hi>and encreaſed in goods, amd haſt need of nothing; but thou knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked.</hi> Thirdly (which is moſt dangerous of all) ſuch as are in this dead faith, may have, not only a kinde of earneſt repentance as King <hi>Saul</hi> had, deſcribed 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16, 17. and as King <hi>Ahab</hi> had, <hi>who rent his clothes in great repentance, and p[ut on ſack cloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſack cloth, and walked ſo mournfully, that the Lord, the ſearcher of hearts, ſaid: Seeſt thou not how Ahab is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before me?</hi> But alſo ſuch may have a great zeale of Gods glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. in devout, holy deſire, and walking (as they are perſwaded) in all Gods holy Commandements, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. ſo zealouſly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their ſins legally, that concerning the good works, and righteouſneſſe of the good and holy law of
<pb facs="tcp:192569:5"/> God, they may be unreproveable, and unblameable; and yet lie in ſin, death, and in a damnable eſtate, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. And many other Jewes before their converſion out of the dead faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3. who were devout perſons, <hi>Acts 13. 50. Inſtantly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God day night, Acts</hi> 26. 7. whereby ſuch ſtriving (as it were) who ſhall ſerve and worſhip God the beſt way, by the beſt works, they are diſtracted thereby into divers ſects, errours, ſchiſmes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions about works. And yet, notwithſtanding all this great knowledge and zeale, whilſt they lie ſleeping in this dead faith; in which ſpirituall ſleep the Lord of <hi>wiſedome Chriſt Ieſus hath foretold and forewarned us, that many, in the laſt dayes of all, ſhall ſlumber and ſleep, Math.</hi> 25. 25. And therefore ſhall theſe laſt dayes be moſt perillous and dangerous times; becauſe men ſhall abound in all cloaked corruptions, <hi>having a forme and ſhew of godlineſſe, but denying the truth and power of the ſame, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 1. to 6. verſe. Theſe, becauſe they have not on the wedding-garment, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 11, 12. doe not only beare a name, by this dead faith and blinde zeale, that they live, when they are dead, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 1. but alſo do give Chriſt hereby but a <hi>Iudas</hi> his kiſſe, ſaying, haile Goſpel, but doe betray it; and ſo doe lie under greater ſinne, wrath and damnation, than if they had never knowne and profeſſed Chriſt at all. And becauſe the only meanes to call theſe people out of this moſt dangerous dead faith, and to rectifie their ſtraggling zeales, is to lay forth the glory of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe, that only makes us fit Brides for ſo glorious a Bridegroom as Chriſt Jeſus is, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 19. which is put on, only
<pb facs="tcp:192569:6"/> by underſtanding, and a joyfull faith, and right em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the excellency of <hi>Free Iuſtification by Chriſt alone, Revel.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Therefore have I here endeavoured <hi>(pro meo modulo)</hi> to lay forth, in this Treatiſe, this ſaid excellency of <hi>Free Iuſtification.</hi> For which, to performe ſome ſpark of faithfulneſſe herein to Gods Church, our Kings, and to my Countrey, I have ſuffered <hi>much hurry;</hi> and have, by divers impriſonments, in ſome meaſure, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved my miniſtry in tumults, and in labours, by ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and good report, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 8. Becauſe we ought not (gentic Reader) to content our ſelves (as too many doe) with the bare name of <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> and know it (as they that are in the dead faith doe) with a carnall knowledge only; whereby ſuch doe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly and blaſphemouſly think and ſay, that this only ſaving benefit opens the gate to all wickedneſſe: neither muſt we content our ſelves (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.) with a meere taſte only of this heavenly gift, as it is often called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 19. which bare taſte only makes us to lie in the fearfull danger of falling away from it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. worſe than the Galathians did. But if we have one ſpark of ſpirituall life by the Goſpel; we, but eſpecially Gods Miniſters, muſt labour (they by preaching, and you by hearing, reading, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon it) to get a true, lively, and rejoycing knowledge of it; for when it works joy, peace, and content with God in the heart, then hath a man the true and right knowledge of it: And when a man hath a true, and right ſaving knowledge and faith of it, then it hath brought him into the <hi>Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Math.</hi> 11. 11, 12. and worketh in his heart peace,
<pb facs="tcp:192569:6"/> and great joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdome of heaven is righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18. as it is further proved in the Treatiſe following.</p>
            <p>Now this joyfull right knowledge is wrought and attained by this meanes, namely, by marking, and often rubbing the memory, and by deeply meditating upon <hi>Gods word of grace,</hi> and teſtimonies of the faithfull Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors, as they expreſſe the <hi>Excellency</hi> of free Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the truth of faith. For as it is neceſſary that we dive into the knowledge of this benefit, <hi>ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus rapiatur vero,</hi> that our underſtanding may be enlightened and poſſeſſed with this only ſoule-ſaving truth of God; ſo it is neceſſary that we look into the <hi>Excellency</hi> of it; <hi>ut voluntas rapiatur bono,</hi> that our will and affections may be raviſhed and carried after the goodneſſe and excellency of the benefit; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right true meanes, both of begetting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing true faith, and of going with a right foot to the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. as it is manifeſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15, 17. where it is ſaid, <hi>that the feet that bring glad tidings of peace, and glad tidings of good things are both beautifull,</hi> making the comming of the true Preachers of the Goſpel comfortable; and alſo mighty for the working of faith and true prayer, and all good life, and godly converſation. For thus is the whole man converted, by this benefit, unto the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured knowledge of his free ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. For <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> of that thing whereof the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellency is not knowne, there is no deſire. And ſeeing the dead faith is a cold apprehending of Chriſt, and his wonderfull benefits, upon a uſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:192569:7"/> cuſtome of the Countrey; becauſe all the Countrey that we live in, is of that beliefe, as we generally and confuſedly conceive, rather than a ſound underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the ſame; whereof enſueth either a luke-warme careleſſe life, led unthankfully for the ſame, or elſe a breaking forth into a blinde zeale of ſome new ſtrange works and life; by which we may provide (as we think) more ſafely for our ſalvation. Becauſe it is moſt true, which the Apoſtle teſtifieth, that theſe falſe-zealous ones, <hi>whilſt they are ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, cannot chooſe but goe about to ſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, and ſo doe not ſubmit themſelves to</hi> reſt contented in <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, Rom.</hi> 10. 2, 3. What other ſalve is there then to cure the cold diſeaſe of this dead faith, and ſelfe-loving zeale, than to lay forth the <hi>Excellency</hi> of free Juſtification, that may enflame the heart ſo with the fiery coales of Gods love towards us, that it may flame forth with a right zeale of keeping within our liſts of obedience, to our Proteſtnt godly governours; and within the limits of our vocations, to doe them thankfully and zealouſly to the glorifying of God, and benefiting of our brethren and neighbours, for ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and glorious, and full ſufficient a benefit? Yea this is the benefit by which we are new borne againe, and reclaimed from all prophaneneſſe, Sects, Schiſms, and Diviſions whatſoever. Which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to travell in birth againe, like a loving mother, with the diſtracted and ſeduced Galathians, untill by reducing them to the truth, and purity of <hi>free Iuſtification, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Chriſt was formed in them againe, Gal.</hi> 4. 19. And yet they profeſſed, that they conſtantly embraced
<pb facs="tcp:192569:7"/> Chriſt, and held Juſtification by him: but becauſe the falſe brethren had perſwaded them, it was not ſufficient for their ſalvation, except they joyned therewith the obedience and keeping of the Law; thereby they loſt Chriſt, life, and their free ſalvation by him. Which evidently declareth, that then only are people new borne againe truly, and Chriſt is formed truly in them, when for the aſſurance of their ſalvation, they wholly reſt in the joyfull knowledge &amp; full ſufficiency of their free Juſtification; then is Chriſt rightly formed in them. This is the Antidote and preſervative againſt all ſweet, poyſonous doctrines of our works, and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious well-doings: this is the preſervative againſt theſe infectious and contagious times: this is the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> that will beare us up above all the floods, and billowes of theſe tempeſtuous dayes of ſundry Sects, Schiſmes, and ſtragling opinions: this is the anchor, whereunto the cable of our faith being firmely faſtened, will make us to ſtand ſtrong againſt all the violent wayes and winds of Satans bluſterous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both on the right hand, and on the left. Yea let us know for a certainty, that <hi>free Iuſtification</hi> is the very head, heart, and ſoule of all Chriſtian religion, and true worſhip of God; without the true and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full knowledge whereof, our religion is headleſſe, our profeſſion and worſhip is heartleſſe, and our very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous converſation is a meere corruption of the Goſpel, and rottenneſſe, like a body without a ſoule that ſtinketh before God. Briefly in a word, as the perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is only worthy to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the wedding-garment; becauſe all the righteouſneſſe of our unperfect Sanctification is (as the
<pb facs="tcp:192569:8"/> Prophet ſaith) <hi>as filthy, menſtruous, ſtained rags, Eſay</hi> 64. 6. ſo true faith of <hi>free Iuſtification,</hi> being the having on of this wedding-garment, becauſe it alone doth truly aboliſh all the filthy nakedneſſe of our ſins out of Gods ſight, and it alone doth make us perfectly holy, and ſufficiently righteous in the ſight of God freely, without works: Therefore it alone doth make us fit Brides (as I ſaid before) and is only meet to marry us to ſo glorious a Bridegroome, as is the King of glory, Chriſt Jeſus. Yea though a man doe abound in the riches and honours of this world, having his Barnes full of Corne, and his Coffers full of Coyne, and hee himſelfe being cloathed in purple and fine linne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, doth fare well and deliciouſly every day; yet if he not freely taking by the hand of a thankfull, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing faith, and ſo not putting on this wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe (that may make him rich in God) can ſleep one night in his bed in any ſecurity; he is not only the foole in print, mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20. but alſo <hi>this night may the Devils fetch away his ſoule from him; and then whoſe ſhall theſe things be,</hi> which he hath provided? <hi>In this caſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord of wiſedome) <hi>is every one</hi> (be he rich, or be he poore) <hi>that,</hi> by not putting on, by free Juſtification, the wedding-garment of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe, <hi>is not rich in God,</hi> verſ. 21. Oh then let not ſuch an one dare to lay downe his head upon his downe-pillow to ſleep one night in ſafety, nor (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid) ſuffer his eye-lids to ſlumber, untill by taking freely this joy full benefit, and by putting on this wedding-garment, hee hath attained this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſedome, better than his fine gold, by which
<pb facs="tcp:192569:8"/> hee may lie downe ſafely, and ſleep ſweetly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13. to 26.</p>
            <p>But I have here laid forth this Excellency of free Juſtification in the words, teſtimonies, and common conſent of the faithfull Expoſitors, and Diſpenſers of Gods myſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2. for three principall Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe as this myſtery of free Juſtification only and freely ſaveth us; ſo by the rebelliouſneſſe of our blinde and ſinfull natures, and unbeliefe of our hearts, and the exceeding ſubtlety of Satan, it is of all the reſt of the benefits of the Goſpel, which all depend upon this benefit, the moſt difficultly learned, and the moſt hardly beleeved. It being moſt true, that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith in his Preface before Dr. <hi>Luther</hi> upon the Galathians, <hi>That Learning cannot reach it, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is offended at it, Nature is aſtonied, Devils doe not know it, Men doe perſecute it; And briefly, as there is no way to life ſo eaſie, ſo there is none ſo hard: Eaſie to whom it is given from above; but hard to the carnall ſenſe, not yet inſpired: the ignorance whereof is the cauſe and root of all the Errours, Sects, and Diviſions that are in all Chriſtendome.</hi> Therefore I thought it fit in this caſe to imitate the example not only of learned and ancient <hi>Bede,</hi> (who maketh an expoſition of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with the meere ſentences, ſayings, and expoſitions of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> collected and gathered together, as the expounded texts and verſes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſcattered here and there in all S. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> works; and therefore are called <hi>Collectanea Bedae:)</hi> but rather to imitate S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe; who diſcerning how hardly free Juſtification is rightly underſtood,
<pb facs="tcp:192569:9"/> ſoundly embracing, contentedly reſted in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retained; as is for ever recorded by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſoone and dangerous fall of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. doth therefore in writing to the Galathians, come forth not ſingly by himſelfe alone; but (as it were) guarded with the aſſociation, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conſent of all his beleeving and faithfull bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaying thus: <hi>And all the Brethren with me, Gal.</hi> 1. 2. Upon which words Dr. <hi>Luthers</hi> expoſition is very remarkable, ſaying thus: <hi>Quaſi dicat Paulus,</hi> as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, leſt I ſhould be alone, <hi>I adde moreover and beſides my ſelfe, all the Brethren which write this Epiſtle, as well as I, and beare witneſſe with me, that my doctrine is good and godly.</hi> Therefore leſt we ſhould ſeeme, or they might ſay, that I only ſet my ſelfe proudly againſt them, I have my Brethren with me, all of one minde, as faithfull witneſſe, which think, write, and teach the ſelfe ſame thing that I doe; and I, that only which they doe. For the better diſcerning whereof: firſt I ſet downe the ſweet, powerfull, and forceable Scriptures, as the flowers containing the honey; then I adde the expoſitions, teſtimonies, and conſent of the learned Writers, as the honey it ſelfe; which they, like the laborious <hi>Bees of the Lords garden,</hi> have, by faith, ſucked and gathered out of the ſaid flowers of Scriptures; ſetting the ſentence and ſaying of each Author by it ſelf, as giving to each Bee his own and (as it were) proper <hi>cellulam</hi> of honey: I changing nothing in the ſubſtance of their ſayings, but only the connecting conjuctions, that may moſt fitly conjoyn the coherence of their teſtimonies together. And yet thus is compoſed in one continuall flowing ſpeech,
<pb facs="tcp:192569:9"/> this Treatiſe, as one whole and entire <hi>honey Combe of Free Iuſtification.</hi> For which one benefit, <hi>David</hi> that had good experience of it, and yet ſaw it, but a farre off darkly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. yet pronounces the word teaching the ſame, to be <hi>ſweeter than honey, and the honey-comb, and more to bee deſired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold, Pſalm.</hi> 19. 10. I have moreover noted in the Margin the name of each Author; and would (but that the Book would grow into a needleſſe bigneſſe) have expreſſed the whole Latine ſentence of ſuch Authors as write in Latine; but yet I have ſet down the beginning of the Latine ſentences in the Margine, or the principall Originall word of chiefeſt Emphaſis in the ſentence, and have noted with figures the places where to finde the ſame, That ſuch as aredeſirous to goe to the Originall, may know where to finde theſe ſentences and teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon of expreſſing the excellencie of Free Juſtification, in the words and teſtimonies, and common conſent of the Learned Orthodox Writers, is this; That whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that there is but one true ſaying faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. ſealed by one Baptiſme, that hath alwayes, in all Ages, moſt freely and moſt certainly ſaved all the Elect: Here thou maiſt ſee as in a cleer looking-glaſſe, what that one Faith is, that hath ſo unfallibly in all Ages, ſaved all the people of God; which muſt needs tend to the ſtrengthening of thee in thy moſt holy Faith, <hi>Iud.</hi> 20. ſtrongly and effectually, when thou heareſt them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing with their own mouths, and with conſent, what truth of Faith doth apprehend in this myſticall, maine benefit; plainly ſhewing how <hi>they have believed</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192569:10"/> 
               <hi>with the heart unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> and how <hi>they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsed the ſame unto ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 10. 10. And alſo doth ſtop the mouthes of the common Adverſaries of Faith and free grace; that upon the divers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſures of Faith in this maine benefit of free grace, in Orthodox and Proteſtant Writers, of this maine myſterie of the Goſpel, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. doe object much difference, diſſent, and diſ-agreement, in this only point of <hi>free ſalvation,</hi> amongſt the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writers; and thereby little ſweetneſſe and excellencie in this glorious free benefit. Who have their vanitie here confuted, and diſpelled with the common conſent of all the beſt, Orthodox and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writers, as, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>according to the Analogie and nature of right and pure Faith,</hi> they expreſſe the excellencie of <hi>Free Iuſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third reaſon is this, That many being much troubled in minde in theſe moſt dangerous dayes; (not knowing which way to turne them among ſo many minds ſo diverſly diſtracted about matters of religion, and therefor have ſome regard to that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie and principall admonition in this caſe of the Prophet, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 6. 16. ſaying, <hi>Stand in the wayes, and inquire for the old way, which is the good way, that you may walk in it, and finde reſt for your ſoules:)</hi> may here ſee, what that old way, and good way is, even the ſame, in which old <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, David, Daniel,</hi> and all the faithfull to this preſent time have walked in, and found reſt to their ſoules; and ſo is manifeſt to bee the old way, and only good way that by walking in it, only brings peace and reſt unto our ſoules: <hi>For being juſtified by faith, we have peace with</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192569:10"/> 
               <hi>God through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in this life, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. And whom he juſtifieth, them he alſo glorifieth</hi> in the next life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. Therefore give me leave (gentle Reader) to exhort thee to be carefull to keep and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> faſt this pretious benefit; and not only to keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut alſo to keep it pure, without the mixing and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ing of works with it, reſting wholy upon it only forthy full, free, and perfect ſalvation; leſt thou looſe, with the fooliſh <hi>Galathians,</hi> this maine and only meanes of thy <hi>Free Salvation;</hi> and to that end meditate much and often in the excellencie of <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> and ponder theſe ſayings of the learned Writers; and mark their reaſons of true faith grounded upon theſe Scriptures, and believe according as God ſpeaks in theſe eminent Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. And decline not from them to the conceits and reaſons of Reaſon. For as meditation (as both the word of God teacheth, and is plentifully teſtified by all experienced Divines) is a moſt profitable religious duty, for the encreaſing of thy moſt holy faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 10. And as the Spirit of God by <hi>Solomon,</hi> exhorts thee to <hi>acquaint thy ſelfe with the ſentences of the wiſe:</hi> So none are more god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſe for thee unto ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. than the true and faithfull Diſpenſers and Stewards of God, writing upon the excellencie of this great myſterie: who are enriched thereunto by the ſpirit of faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. and doe ground themſelves upon the pure Word of God expounded by faith, and not corrupted by reaſon: So that he that deſpiſeth theſe teſtimonies, doth runne directly into the ſinne which the ſpirit of God forbiddeth, ſaying, <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſie, 1. Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. that is, the Diſpenſers of Gods myſteries,
<pb facs="tcp:192569:11"/> ſpeaking unto <hi>Edifying, to exhortation and comfort, 1 Cor. 14. 3. But yet try all things, and keep that which is good. 1 Theſ. 5. 21. But whoſoever deſpiſeth theſe, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth God and Chriſt, Luk.</hi> 10. 16. Again, no matter of Religion can bee meditated in, more profitably, than this Article of free Juſtification, that only and freely ſaveth us. For thou ſhalt finde that the very reading and meditating upon it, either in this Book or in any other, where thou ſhalt finde the excellencie of it, more powerfully laid open (for I ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my weakneſſe herein;) This meditation (I ſay) being an effectuall meanes to apprehend it deeper and deeper, and to encreaſe thy knowledge and faith in it (eſpecially, when thou feeleſt thy conſcience pricked and troubled with ſinne) will even breath the ſpirit of God, and life into thy ſoule, as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>Received you the ſpirit by hearing the Law? Or by hearing of faith, viz.</hi> of free Juſtification <hi>preached? Gal.</hi> 3. 2. And ſo will be, as it were the ſoule of thy ſoule to revive thee to eternall life: yea, thou ſhalt feele that thy often meditating in this heavenly gift (like <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeventimes waſhing of himſelfe in the River <hi>Iordane)</hi> will aſſure thee clearer and clearer, that all the ſpirituall leproſie of thy ſinnes, is waſhed away cleane out of Gods ſight. By which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, as it were thy Baptiſme, thou mayſt be anew ſtrengthened with the ſpirituall inward ſeale of joy and gladneſſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 7, 8. Neither let thy unworthineſſe of ſo great a benefit deterre thee from taking it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is given thee freely: I ſay freely, that is, God reſpecting no worthineſſe in thee to deſerve it; nor, no unworthineſſe in thee to hinder thy free taking of
<pb facs="tcp:192569:11"/> it: but only pittying thy miſery doth give it thee freely to this end, to declare the glory of his <hi>free Grace,</hi> and to heale freely all thine unworthineſſe; and to make thee freely worthy of all the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and bleſſings of God, both temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Thus <hi>(Chriſtian Reader)</hi> if Chriſtianly paſſing by all my weakneſſes in handling this glorious free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; yet if thou ſhalt here finde that the learned Writers collected have ſaid ſome thing that may edifie thee in thy moſt holy faith, then ſhall I be well content and fully ſatisfied. Commending thee to God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able to build further, I with all my poor endeavours doe wholly reſt,</p>

Should the Devill ſuffer all this? Should not the father of lies employ all his force, and ſubtle policies to darken, to corrupt, and utterly root out this doctrine of ſalvation and everlaſting life? Indeed S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth in all his Epiſtles, that even in his dayes the Devill ſhewed himſelfe a cunning work-man in his buſineſſe, by dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening and hindring this doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Now for uſe, let this ſuffice in this place, to ſtirre up Gods children by theſe and the like reaſons, to <hi>fortifie</hi> their judgements in this maine point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith. The Article of Juſtification is the very ſumme of the Goſpel; that once corrupted, there can be no ſoundneſſe; that truly and thorowly underſtood, and beleeved, and applied, armes againſt all aſſaults of Satan: and let us be exhorted, as to edifie our ſelves in all other points of our moſt holy faith; ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this; which who ſo holds not aright, ſurely he holds not the head, nor ever can be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the neceſſity of earneſt teaching, and diligent learning of this doctrine of Juſtification: Let us now proceed to ſhew the nature of it, and what it is.</p>

               <p>As in the firſt Commandement, namely, <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>

               <p>Secondly, in the ſecond Commandement, contayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the outward worſhip of God; although peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou makeſt not groſly to thy ſelfe <hi>any graven Image</hi> of God the father, nor <hi>any Picture</hi> of Chriſt, as the Papiſts doe; yet look how often, and how many allurements have enticed thee to neglect either the preaching or the zealous hearing of the word being offered either <hi>in ſeaſon</hi> or <hi>out of ſeaſon;</hi> look how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thou haſt neglected to bow thy knees in ſolemne prayer to God, three times a day with <hi>Daniel, David,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, in the third Commandement; although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> peradventure thou art not guilty of groſſe blaſpheming of God, yet look what zeale thou wanteſt in life, for the threefold works of God upon thee, as namely of Creation, Redemption, and continuall preſervation; look how often in word thou haſt ſworne by thy faith and troth, by the fire, by the light, by bread, or any other creature of God; ſo often art thou guilty (Chriſt being witneſſe, <hi>Mat. 5.)</hi> of taking Gods <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 34, 35, 36.</note> name in vaine; look how often thou haſt raſhly taken up and uſed the titles of God, as <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is God bleſſed for ever, &amp;c. look how often thou haſt unreverently uſed the properties of God, as his <hi>grace</hi> to practiſe vanity, his <hi>mercy</hi> to ſinne, his <hi>Judgements</hi> to curſing, and haſt abuſed his <hi>providence</hi> in crying out upon luck and fortune, and ſuch like; look how often in the creatures, thou not marking the power of God in making the creatures, his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in fitting them to thy neceſſities, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in giving them unto thee; but turning them from their right uſe, as the drink to drunkeneſſe, thy tongue to lying, and ſuch like; ſo abuſing them to

               <p>Fifthly, in the fifth Commandement; if ſuch as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be ſuperiours doe not inſtruct the ſoules of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in religion, and in the knowledge and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Chriſt, and cauſe them not to doe their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions zealouſly, for the love and glory of Chriſt: And look how often inferiours forgetting their inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,

               <p>Sixthly, when thou haſt not committed the groſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> act of murther, thou maiſt think thy ſelfe to bee as cleere from murther as the Scribes and Phariſes did: but Chriſt doth convince both them and thee, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Foure wayes guilty of u ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though no bodily hurt be done.

But ſecondly, if thou ſay <hi>Raca,</hi> that is, doſt expreſſe thine anger with taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and reproachfull termes, as, <hi>marry come up, fie you ſir, ſurely you are an hot ſhot,</hi> and ſuch like; now thou art a murtherer in an higher degree, and haſt pulled an heavier judgement of murther upon thine head. But if ſo farre forgetting meekneſſe, gentleneſſe, and patience, the very heart of this Commandement, thou ſay, <hi>foole;</hi> that is, if thou burſt forth in thine anger into open railing, as to ſay, <hi>Rogue, Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Knave, Whore, Drab, Beaſt,</hi> and ſuch like; now thou art a murtherer in the higheſt degree of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192569:25"/> murther, and haſt pulled an high judgement of hell fire upon thy head. Yea further, if thy brother have ought againſt thee, that is, if thou haſt not ſuch ſincere love, ſo that thou haſt given any matter of wrong, and diſcontent, and juſt complaint, not being by labour, money, and counſell helpfull to the needy, thou art guilty of ſuch deep murther in the ſight of God, that till thou beeſt reconciled unto thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God abhorres all thy ſacrifices, ſervice, prayers, and worſhips.

               <p>Seventhly, as in the ſeventh Commandement; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt not peradventure committed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> groſſe act of Adultery, yet if thou look with the leaſt motion of luſt upon a woman, or the woman upon the man, and ſo any thought of uncleaneſſe ariſe in thy heart, thou art now a foule Adulterer in the ſight of God: but look how often thou haſt uſed any wanton, or any other obſcene words; now thou art a filthy adulterer in an higher degree in the ſight of God: but look how often thou haſt uſed any wanton geſture or action, either in gariſh apparell, or in any other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton behaviour that may allure and ſtirre up luſt; now thou art a filthy adulterer in the higheſt degree of ſpirituall adultery: how horrible then is the practiſing of the groſſe act in the ſight of God?</p>

               <p>The fifth Scripture, phraſe expreſſing yet in an higher degree, how truely all our ſinnes are utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed out of Gods ſight; and how perfectly cleane the blood of Chriſt doth make us from all ſinne, is this; That God himſelfe, whoſe eyes are all ſeeing, and ſearching the heart and reines, yet teſtifieth, that hee doth ſee no ſin in his juſtified children; and to the glory of his work wrought in the Brazen-Serpent, wherewith hee had newly healed his people, hee doubleth his ſpeech ſaying; <hi>God ſeeth no iniquity in</hi> Jaacob; <hi>and he ſeeth no tranſgreſsion in Iſraell, Numb.</hi>

               <p>For the fathers under the Law had the ſame promiſes of forgiveneſſe of ſinnes which we have, and truſting to the ſame, they called upon God, and did rejoyce in forgiveneſſe and pardon obtained: But here the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brings, as it were, a certaine new matter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not heard of, promiſing that under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with one offering the children of God ſhould be made ſo perfect for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. that there ſhall be no remembrance of ſinne before God.</p>
               <p>Now then God doth not ſo much as remember our ſinnes; becauſe now there is one cleanſing made for them all, once making us perfect for ever.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow before we proceed to the ſecond part of Juſtification, I think it will not be amiſſe to anſwer certaine objections, which the two enimies of free Juſtification, namely, naturall reaſon and unbeliefe, do raiſe up againſt this firſt part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: but before wee come to the objections, it is not impertinent to ſay ſomething of the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, or perſons making theſe objections; of whom diſcretion wills us to note, that they are of three <note place="margin">The different ſorts of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are three 1</note> ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt are Papiſts, who although they grant that we are juſtified by the free grace of God, through the merits of Chriſt, whereby all ſinnes, when a man is juſtified, be pardoned him; yet they can by no means brook, that we are made perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God freely, without any good works, or holy walking wrought by us: this (ſay they) is falſe and hereticall doctrine, and in their deep wiſedome and learning they cry out (as it was objected againſt <hi>Paul)</hi> that this opens the gate to all wickedneſſe, and that then men may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192569:40"/> live as they liſt; And that the Law of God becomes unprofitable; And that then men may continue in ſin, that this grace of ſo perfect aboliſhing our ſins may abound; with many other ſuch like cavills, which by the Proteſtant Antagoniſts, are fully anſwered, eſpecially by <hi>Calvin,</hi> from the eleventh chapter, to the twentieth of the third book of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of objectors, are ſuch as being in <note place="margin">Second ſort of objectors.</note> name Proteſtants, &amp; profeſſing themſelves utter enimies to Papiſts, in that (as they ſay) they will not give the leaſt piece of Juſtification to works and holy walking, and will ſeeme both to themſelves and others to hold Free Juſtification perfectly: And yet, becauſe of their being in the dead faith, they do not underſtand it; and becauſe by conceiving it after a carnall humane wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-faſhion, they feele no ſweetneſſe in it: therefore declining in affection unto the ſtabliſhing of their own righteouſneſſe, they not only nullifie Free Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make it as good as nothing; but alſo making the light of nature deſcribed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14. 15.</note> reaſon their chiefeſt guide; they weaken the faith of others, by running into the very objections of the Papiſts; and ſhake hands with them in the maine points of ſalvation, with whom they would ſeeme to be at utter variance. And all this (I ſay againe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lie in the dead faith, whereby they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the nature and excellency of Free Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet one ſuch may doe us more harme in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our faith than many Papiſts; not only, becauſe they profeſſe with us one and the ſame profeſſion, in letter; and ſo are like homebred flattering enimies; but alſo, becauſe by great literall learning and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192569:40"/> they may beare a great name, that they live, when by the dead faith they indeed are <hi>dead, Rev.</hi> 3. 1. Therefore <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 1.</note> that theſe objectors do not weaken our faith, wee muſt learne to diſcerne theſe underminers of our faith. But peradventure ſome will ſay, how may wee diſcerne them? I anſwer, by knowing and diligent marking <note place="margin">The nature of the dead faith.</note> the nature of the <hi>dead faith,</hi> which is this; to hold the very truth after a ſort, as farre as the light of nature, good memorie, and good humane wit can reach; and herein to think themſelves <hi>rich and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, Revel.</hi> 3. 17. being aſhamed <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 17.</note> not to hold as all the Countrey of our profeſſion is thought to hold, ſticking faſt to ſuch phraſes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſeeme to agree with their human wit and reaſon: but becauſe ſuch <hi>by hearing, do heare</hi> after a literall maner, <hi>but doe not underſtand; and by ſeeing, doe ſee</hi> after a carnall human-witted faſhion, <hi>but doe not perceive; Mat.</hi> 13. 13, 14. therefore they talk of that which they <note place="margin">Matt. 13. 13. 14.</note> hold, as men talk of things in their ſleep, and can ſay, <hi>Siboleth,</hi> but not <hi>Shiboleth: Iudg.</hi> 12. 6. that is, can <note place="margin">Iudg. 12. 6.</note> ſay ſomething; but not make a cleere and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſſion of the myſteries of Chriſt: but if that bee preſſed upon them, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:192569:46"/> ſaying, that God hath made his children ſo perfectly holy and righteous in his ſight that he ſees no ſinne in them, in and by their Juſtification. Hereby theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors doe make Chriſts wedding garment to bee (by their alledging this Scripture) no better a covering and aboliſher of our ſinnes out of Gods ſight, than the covering which the wicked and ungodly (there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of) doe make to themſelves by their hypoeriſie and ſecurity: ſaying thus in effect, that as the wicked and reprobates (there properly ſpoken of) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinne, although they hide and cover them over with ſuch faire pretences and ſhewes, that they are as ſecure as if God did not ſee them; and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as the Prophet truly ſaith) God doth both know and ſee them to bee horrible and abhominable in his ſight: even ſo the children of God; terrified more with the horribleneſſe of ſinne, in the ſight of God, than with the puniſhment, although they flying to Chriſt, hee (by clothing them with the wedding garment of his owne righteouſneſſe) doe not only cover them (which ſimilitude is ſpoken in reſpect of our feeling of them continually dwelling in us) but alſo in reſpect of God, hath utterly aboliſhed them out of his Fathers ſight, by making them of unjuſt juſt; that is, <hi>re ipſa,</hi> in very deed, perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God, freely: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (ſay theſe Objectors alledging this place for their proofe) hee ſees their ſinnes in them: which is as much as if they ſhould ſay, hee ſees them not of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt made juſt; that is, perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God, freely: but ſees them ſtill although there been no puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them for the ſame) in the ſoule pickle of

               <p>But how comes God to ſee them in us, after hee hath covered them out of his own ſight? Theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors anſwer; By looking under the covering. But I would gladly know of them, wherefore did God cover them out of his ſight, if hee peepe under the covering to ſee them againe? Or, I would know of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God ſo cover our ſinnes out of his owne ſight, as men cover things with a net, that lye as naked to view as they did before they were covered? But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by thus alleadging of this Scripture, hereby the juſtified (excepting ſome difference of guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment) yet in reſpect of the ſin it ſelfe, which is worſe than the guilt and puniſhment, being the image of the Devill; and in reſpect of Gods ſeeing the very being of ſin in them, are made all one with the Reprobate and wicked.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Gods covering is made all one with mans covering, nay rather with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull covering which the wicked make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, the wedding-garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is made all one in reſpect of the being of ſinne it ſelfe in Gods ſight, with the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and ſecurity of the wicked. Are not every one of theſe points horrible blaſphemy againſt Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe? Thus handſomely and thus properly doth unbeliefe and infidelity alleadge Scriptures: may we not worthily ſuſpect theſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in alleadging other Scriptures againſt the truth, that alledge this ſo abſurdly?</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:192569:47"/>
               <p>Againe, ſecondly, this allegation ſeeming to ſtand for, and defend the all-ſeeing nature of God, is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous; not only becauſe it robs God of his power; namely, that God cannot above our reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling make his children ſo perfectly holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from all ſpot of ſin in his ſight freely, that he doth ſee no ſin in them: but alſo, whereas by the truth of his Word, and by the power of Chriſts blood, and by the teſtimony of all the former faithfull witneſſes, he doth ſo: and true faith that ſees inviſible things more plainely, than any demonſtration can make them, and doth ſee it more brightly than any bodibly ſenſe can diſcerne it: but on the other ſide, unbeliefe is blind and cannot ſee and diſcern inviſible things; yet ſhee is not content to bee blind her ſelfe, but alſo being as bold as blind <hi>Bayard,</hi> ſhee would goe about to make God blind alſo; <hi>viz.</hi> that he cannot ſee this his own myſticall and ſupernaturall work, wrought in and upon his children, by the blood and righteouſneſſe of his own Son, but he muſt needs bee blind: thus this blind bold <hi>Bettereſſe</hi> unbeliefe makes God to her ſelfe both impotent, blind, and <hi>a liar, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 10. and then <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 10.</note> layes the blame of all this upon faith. And thus men ſtumbling at the block of their own ſenſe, ſight, and feeling, doe break the neck of their faith, &amp; ſo endanger to break the neck of their ſoules. Wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Zachary</hi> the Father of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> is written <note place="margin">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192569:47"/> which hee ſaw and felt in himſelf: how much more if we believe not Chriſt the Prince of Angels, ſpeaking of perfect cleanneſſe in us <hi>Can.</hi> 4. 7.

The Lord keep us from this Judgement, by taking warning of the Prince, that would not beleeve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord; becauſe his reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, ſpake ſtrongly the contrary; and therefore was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully trodden under-foot to death, that he might never <note place="margin">2 King. 7. 20.</note> enjoy the promiſe, 2: <hi>King.</hi> 7. 20.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, for the weaker underſtanding and memory, briefly to re-collect what hath been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this firſt objection breathing out nothing but <note place="margin">Six abſurdities ariſing from former obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> unbelief, do ariſe and enſue theſe ſix maine abſurdities.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the nature and eſſence of Faith, to beleeve what God ſpeaketh, contrary to Reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling is denyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Juſtification of unjuſt, making us Juſt, that is, <hi>reipſa,</hi> perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely, is deſtroyed; and ſo baptiſme is denyed, and Chriſt is denyed: for look how much ſin God ſeeth in us, ſo much unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he ſees in us; look how much unrighteouſneſſe hee ſees in us; ſo much doe we come ſhort of being
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192569:48"/> made perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely; and ſo Chriſt is made an unperfect workman, and baptiſme is damnified. And again wee ſee, that the truely learned hold, that untill the cauſe be thus taken away, which is ſinne it ſelfe; the effects of guilt and puniſhment, doe not truly ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by it hypocriſie is nouriſhed; for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not ſeeing what an infinite horrible thing the ſinne it ſelfe is in the ſight of God, cares for no more, than for ſelfe-love, to have the guilt and puniſhment done away: but as for the ſinne it ſelfe, which is the immediate abuſer of God, and the meere worke and image of the Divell, and ſpirituall high treaſon againſt the higheſt ſpirituall Majeſtie, defiling all her good works; ſhe cares not greatly whether that be taken away; or ſhe by her ſuppoſed holy walking will put out and take away that her ſelfe; ſhe will not truſt Chriſt with that buſineſſe, to doe it by himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, although therein relies the very <hi>glory of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and ſo all her good workes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3. Luke 16. 15.</note> abhominable in the ſight of God <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. But ſinceritie, that ſees what an infinite horrible thing the leaſt ſinne is in the ſight of God, though there were no hell to puniſh it, labours not, through ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, ſo much to have the guilt and puniſhment taken away, which is the leſſe; as to have the blood and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, that may take away and utterly aboliſh, out of Gods ſight, the ſinne it ſelfe, which is the greater, as is to be ſeene in the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 2, 3. 7. Pſal. 19. 12.</note> and other Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 2, 3, 7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. and ſo hath both the ſinne and the effects thereof abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed out of Gods ſight.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:192569:48"/>
               <p>Fourthly, by this objection, ſeeming to defend the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> All-ſeeing, and to magnifie the All ſearching nature of God, we runne into a double errour; firſt, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is Almighty, and ſeeth all things; and it were weakneſſe in God not to ſee that which we ſee, yea, and abſurd and fooliſh ſo to think; and ſuch like. Here we oppoſe the power of God againſt his will: for I grant that he ſeeth all things ſaving that which he will not ſee, that is, the image of the Divell in his children. God ſeeth all things ſaving that which hee himſelfe undertakes to aboliſh out of his own ſight, that he may not ſee it. But doth it ſeeme weakneſſe in God, and fooliſh, that God ſhould not ſee that in us which we ſee, when by myſticall cloathing us with his Sonnes righteouſneſſe, hee hath aboliſhed it out of his owne ſight, but not out of ours, that wee may here live in the faith of Gods power? yet let us remember that we muſt reſt in this, That the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is ſtronger than men, and the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is wiſer than men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 25. And <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 25.</note> weighty and well worthy the marking is that Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of that heroick diſpenſer of Gods myſteries, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luth. in</hi> Galax.</note> ſaying thus: <q>True Chriſtian Divinitie (as I give you often warning) ſetteth not God forth unto us in his Majeſtie, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and other doctrines doe; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us not to ſearch into the nature of God, but to know his will ſet out to us in Chriſt.

Therefore when ſoever thou haſt to doe in <note place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> the matter of Juſtification, and diſputeſt with thy ſelfe, how God will bee found: then know thou, that <note place="margin">Luth. <hi>ibid.</hi> in Galath.</note> there is no other God, beſides this man Jeſus Chriſt: embrace him, ſetting a ſide all curious ſpeculations of the Divine Majeſty: for he that is a ſearcher of Gods Majeſtie, ſhal be over-whelmed by his glory. But out of the matter of Juſtification, when thou muſt diſpute with Jewes, Turkes, Papiſts, Hereticks and ſuch like; concerning the power, wiſdome, and Majeſty of God,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192569:49"/> there employ all thy wit and induſtry to that end, and bee as profound a Diſputer as thou canſt: for then thou art in another vaine; but in the caſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thou muſt withdraw thy minde wholy from all cogitations and ſearching of the Majeſtie of God, and look only upon this man, Chriſt: thus doing, thou ſhalt perceive the love, goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe of God how great it is: And thou ſhalt ſee his wiſdome, power, and Majeſtie ſweetned, and tempered to thy capacity: The Reaſon whereof is plaine, which is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Chriſt, God hath made himſelfe after a ſort, little, that he might ſo ſubmit himſelfe to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Chriſto Deus quodammodo paruum ſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, ut ad cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum noſtrum ſe ſubm ttat.</hi> Cal. in 1 Pet. 1. 21.

The ſecond error, that this objection runs into is, That it ſuppoſeth Gods power, and Almighty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bee diminiſhed and weakned, when indeed it is the more magnified and exalted; becauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and acknowledge that God is able with his Sons righteouſneſſe, of unjuſt to our reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, to make us above our reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling Juſt; (that is, not having one ſpot or wrinkle of ſin, in his ſight) is to attribute, that to the working of Gods power, which to reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, is impoſſible; &amp; ſo greatly glorifies the power of God: Juſt as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did, who withdrawing his eyes from conſidering his own and his Wives barreneſſe, and beleeving that he was fruitfull, and his ſeed ſhould be as the Stars of the Firmament, when yet he felt the clean contrary in himſelfe: hereby he ſtood ſtrong in true faith, and gave glory to God: but how? by knowing that he which had ſpoken it, was alſo able to doe it: and thus hee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192569:50"/> magnified Gods power and glorified his truth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as contrariwiſe by this unbelieving objection, God is made (as is before ſhewed) firſt, impotent in his power: ſecondly, falſe in his word and promiſes: thirdly, blind that he cannot ſee his own and his Sons proper work in, and upon us: whereby fourthly, the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (as <hi>Luther</hi> truly ſaith) is aboliſhed to them by unbeliefe; And the wedding-garment of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe undertaking of unjuſt to make us juſt, that is, perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God freely is fruſtrated and made void. And thus unbeliefe doth all theſe things in truth, wherewith ſhee burthens faith falſly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, although the guilt, that is, (as it is defined) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the binding over to puniſhment, and the puniſhment it ſelfe, doth not remaine, but (as they grant) is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Juſtification: yet (ſay theſe objectors) God ſees the very being of the ſins themſelves in us. But ſeeing, they themſelves grant, that the loathſomneſſe of ſinne is ſo vile and ugly in the ſight of God, that it muſt be covered out of his ſight before God ceaſeth to be diſpleaſed, and angry with us: and yet it is ſo covered out of his ſight (ſay they) that hee ſtill ſees the being of ſin in his deareſt Saints. Hereof it muſt needs follow that either that ſinne, which hee ſees in them, is not ſo vile and ugly in his ſight (as it was before granted) or elſe thoſe deare Saints muſt needs be very vile and ugly in his ſight, by that vile and ugly ſin, that he ſees in them: for if God ſee ſome of their ſins in them, hee ſees all their ſins in them; if all, then ſeeing it is ſin it ſelfe, and nothing elſe but ſin, and that alſo but one ſin, even in thought only that doth defile men in the ſight of God, as Chriſt teſtifieth,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192569:50"/> 
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 21, 23. Hence it followes, that the Juſtified <note place="margin">Mark. 7. 21. 23.</note> muſt needs remaine ſtill more foule in his ſight, with the many ugly ſins that hee ſeeth in them', being the image of the Devill, than any ſwine can bee defiled over body, head and eares in our ſight with mire; and more foule and loathſome, with the ugly ſin that hee ſees in them, being the poyſon of hell, than any Spider or Toade can be full of loathſome poyſon in our ſight; and thus their deare Saints, are as foule as ugly Devils in the ſight of God, with that vile and ugly ſin that hee ſeeth in them: but that their remaines no guilt nor puniſhment to be inflicted upon them, for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, hereby are overthrown all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> other benefits of the Goſpel: as firſt, God being the fountaine of all Juſtice and righteouſneſſe; God (as the Doctrine of our Church ſaith) cannot but deteſt and abhor us, as long as he ſees us in our ſins; the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof is ſuch in his ſight, untill wee be firſt made cleane from it. Secondly, the holy Ghoſt will not come to dwell in ſuch foule hogg-ſties of ugly ſinne. Thirdly, Chriſt will not knit ſuch foule ugly members into himſelfe, the members muſt be ſuteable to the head. Fourthly, Chriſt will not marry unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo foule a ſow, or filthy ſwine, untill he have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her cleane from that which doth deforme and defile, which is the ugly ſinne it ſelfe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 27. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 27.</note> Fifthly, God will not acknowledge, much leſſe adopt for his Sons and daughters, thoſe whom hee ſees full of the image of the Devill. Sixthly, no unclean thing can enter into the kingdome of Chriſt, which is the the kingdome of heaven here on earth; for <hi>except a man bee born again,</hi> that is, made a perfect new creature
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192569:51"/> to the eyes of God by Juſtification, and declare the ſame by being made a new creature to the eyes of men by Sanctification, <hi>he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God, Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. becauſe the Kingdome of God is nothing <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3.</note> but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now then we may eaſily ſee whether theſe Objectors ſlipping from the excellency of free Juſtification, taught by the firſt and pureſt Orthodox writers of the ſame, are not to rectifie their judgements; and ſeeing they goe about to maintaine their unbeliefe with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall cavils, whether a Miniſter, upon paine of the for feiture of his faithfulneſſe, be not to convince them ſharply, that they may be <hi>ſound in faith, Tit.</hi> 1. 9. 13. And thus have I ſtood more largely in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9, 13.</note> this objection; becauſe I finde by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that this cavill againſt the excellency of free Juſtification doth ſtick ſo faſt between the teeth of naturall reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, that many ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling (as I ſaid before) at this block of their ſenſe and feeling, doe greatly endanger the breaking of the neck of their faith; and ſo make it a dead ſaith, good for nothing, neither to glorifie God, nor ſave their ſoules; but hereupon I may be briefer in the reſt.</p>
               <p>The next objection is this: <hi>God knowes the ſinnes</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

               <p>To which I anſwer; that this objection is like <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>

               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Scriptures doe diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them: for as it is a ſin to diſtinguiſh where the Scriptures doe not diſtinguiſh; for which cauſe the Schoolmen are juſtly taxed of all learned Proteſtants, to have corrupted the Goſpel, and all Religion by their idle and curious diſtinctions not uſed in the Scripture (whereupon that new diſtinction between the guilt and the ſin, namely, that Chriſt hath taken away from before his Father, or out of his fathers ſight, not the ſin it ſelfe, but the guilt of our ſins, that wee by our holy walking may take away the ſin it ſelfe out of Gods ſight, is the more worthily to be ſuſpected for a corrupter of the Goſpel; becauſe the Goſpel of Chriſt makes no ſuch diſtinction: ſaying no where that Chriſt hath taken away the guilt of our ſins; but ſaying every where, that the ſin it ſelfe, and the effects and puniſhments thereof are taken away out of Gods ſight:) ſo on the other ſide, where God doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for our capacities, there it is a ſin for us not to diſtinguiſh. And therefore ſeeing Gods word in this point doth diſtinguiſh, not only in words, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. <note place="margin">Pſal 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:192569:52"/> this diſtinction, if all men, Devils and Angels would gaineſay it, muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe if we doe not by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prying into Gods incomprehenſible nature, caſt our ſelves into a maze, and (as <hi>Luther</hi> truly ſaith) by curious ſpeculations of the divine majeſty, fall with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and loſe God, his Goſpel, and all together, we may diſcerne ſome difference even in nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween knowing and ſeeing, both before God, men, and Angels; for to know a thing, is to underſtand the nature of it, although the thing it ſelfe be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, taken away, and have no ſubſtance, exiſtence, and being, really before them; but properly to ſee a thing, is, before God, men, and Angels, to have the thing it ſelfe unaboliſhed, not taken away, but having exiſtence, and reall being preſently before them. As for example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. it is not ſaid that God <hi>ſaw</hi> the <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 10.</note> light, the Sea, the Sun, and Moon, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, before he had given them an exiſtence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but when hee had given them a reall exiſtence and being before him; then it is ſaid, that God ſaw them, and <hi>ſaw that they were good.</hi> As againe let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in an example or two: God now knowes the flood that covered the earth, and drowned the whole world; but he now ſees it aboliſhed, that is, ſees no exiſtence and being of the flood, covering and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth; for if he did, it would ſoone bee woe with us all: ſo likewiſe God knowes the Sacrifices of killing Bulls, and Goates, that were uſed in his firſt Church; but now hee ſees them aboliſhed in his Church, that is, he now ſees no killing of Bulls, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oats in his Church; for if hee did, he ſhould ſee his Church to be Judaicall. Againe, God knowes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:192569:53"/> what flood of fire ſhall burne up the world; but yet he doth not ſee it, by exiſtence and being, burning up the world; for if he did, our houſes would he too hot for us to dwell in. Againe, yet more plainely, God knowes both the wicked and good men, that lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth a thouſand yeares agoe; but he ſees them not now living upon the earth: but hee ſees the wicked in hell, and the good in heaven, where they have now their exiſtence, and preſent being before him. Let me adde a prooſe of Scripture; whilſt <hi>Nathanaels</hi> exiſtence and being was under the Fig-tree, the Godhead of Chriſt did ſee him under the Fig-tree; but when hee was come from thence unto Chriſt, although the Godhead of Chriſt did then know that hee was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fig-tree; yet hee doth not ſay, my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head doth now ſee thee under the Fig-tree, but <hi>I ſaw thee when thou waſt under the Fig-tree:</hi> but now I ſee thee here before mee. So that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not ſeeing hath no relation to any change in God, who is unchangeable, but altogether reſpect unto the change wrought before God upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As (to come nearer to examples confirming our preſent purpoſe) whilſt the exiſtence and being of the Leproſie of <hi>Naaman</hi> was in and upon him, God did ſee it in him and upon him, and ſaw him foule, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous: but when hee was healed, and ſo his Leproſie aboliſhed, although God knew more perfectly then he what Leproſie he was healed of, yet he did not ſee any leprie upon him, when hee was healed; but ſaw his owne new worke of his fleſh reſtored and come to him as the fleſh of a young childe: and is it not groſſe unbeliefe to thinke that the River of Chriſts blood is not able to doe as much, and make as great a change
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192569:53"/> in the ſight of God upon us myſtically above our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſenſe, and feeling, in aboliſhing the lepry of our ſinnes, and in making us perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot or ſinne in the ſight of God freely; as the River of Jordan was powerfull by Gods appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to aboliſh from before him the bodily diſeaſe; ſeeing this was but a figure of the other; and ſeeing the aboliſhing of the bodily diſeaſe was a deſtroying of the worke of God; but the aboliſhing of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſeaſe is a deſtroying of the worke of the Divell? Hereupon I ſay, and diſtinguiſh thus: That God <note place="margin">How God knowes the ſinnes of his children, and of Reprobates.</note> knowes the ſinnes of the wicked and reprobate infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more perfectly than they themſelves doe; and hee knowes the ſinnes of his juſtified Children infinite more perfectly than they themſelves doe, according to that confeſſion of <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, Who knowes the number of his ſinnes? or who knowes how often hee erres? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12.

Thus God did know the ſinnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and left the ſenſe, ſight, and feeling of them to abide to himſelfe, and before men, for which mendid reprove him, that hee might live by the faith of Gods power in aboliſhing them out of his owne ſight, and not by ſenſe and feeling: And yet they were ſo utterly aboliſhed out of Gods ſight, and hee was thereby made ſo perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God, that although men did reprove him (as we ought to reprove one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love) yet we read not that God tooke notice of any ſinne in him; neither did God, being ſo familiar with him, once rebuke him in all his life after his calling for any one ſinne, but did only try and exerciſe his faith. But why did men rebuke him and not God? becauſe he was not perfectly holy and righteous to his owne ſenſe and feeling and to menward by his ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but was perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne to Godward by juſtification; becauſe he was the patterne and Father of them that are freely made ſo holy, that they are without all fault, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all blame in the ſight of God. <hi>Colloſ. 1. 22, 23.</hi> So likewiſe God did know the ſtingings and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <note place="margin">Coloſ. 22. 23.</note> ſwellings and ſoreneſſe of his people wounded in the Wilderneſſe with fiery Serpents; and yet when by meerely looking upon the Brazen Serpent they were healed, hee ſaw no poyſonous ſwellings and ſoreneſſe in them, but ſaw his new worke of health and ſtrength in them, and ſaw them goe in this health and ſtrength againſt their enimies: And ſhall not the true ſubſtance,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192569:55"/> the Sonne of God, Chriſt Jeſus, figured by that ſhadow, heale us much more, though above our reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling, and perfectly aboliſh all the helliſh ſores and poyſon of the fiery Serpent Satan out of Gods ſight; by making us perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God freely?

Contrariwiſe, the Law and works conſiſteth in exacting with threats, in doing by works, and in giving to God; but faith and the voice of the Goſpel requireth no works of us, or that wee ſhould yeeld and give any thing unto God, but that wee beleeving the promiſe of God, ſhould receive of him: As <hi>Abel</hi> offering his ſacrifice, giveth unto God: but he beleeving, receiveth of God.

But if Preachers neglect this rule, and ſo taking the Law for the Goſpel, and the Goſpel for the Law, doe confound them by mixing and mingling them together, either in their eſſence, or objects, or end; either directly and profeſſedly, as the Papiſts doe, or indirectly by prepoſterous urging men to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained righteouſneſſe by legall terrors, then (as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> truely ſaith) they pervert the Goſpel, and become the Miniſters of the Divell: And yet (ſaith he) ſuch perverters of the Goſpell can abide nothing leſſe, then to heare that they are perverters of the Goſpell, and the Apoſtles of the Divell; nay rather they glory above others in the name of Chriſt, and boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the moſt ſincere Preachers of the Goſpel: But becauſe they mingle the Law with the Goſpell, they muſt needs be perverters of the Goſpell: becauſe it doth not only blemiſh and darken the knowledge of Grace; but alſo it doth take away Chriſt, with all

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192569:66"/> in him, and alſo prayed thrice, that the ſame might depart from him: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Juſtified children of God are not made ſo perfectly holy and righteous, that they have not one ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God. To which I anſwer, that although this might bee referred to the former objection out of the ſeventh to the <hi>Rom.</hi> where it is fully anſwered; yet becauſe it is ſo much urged, it is not amiſſe to open this place more fully, that theſe Objectors may ſee how careleſly they trifle with the Scriptures; and ſo take Gods Name in vaine, in alledging, by their ignorance, that ſo much againſt the truth, which being throughly marked makes ſtong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the truth. True it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> and all the true children of God both have and feel the remnants of corruption dwelling in them; yea, and the more grace they have, the more by their true hatred of ſin, and love of righteouſneſſe wrought in them by their Sanctification, doe they feel ſin to bee like a thorn or ſplinter run into their fleſh; whereby they cannot chooſe, but pray <hi>thrice,</hi> and <hi>thrice,</hi> and <hi>thrice;</hi> that is continually groan by the vigor and force of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall, continuall, true repentance, and ſtill ſigh to be freed from the ſame; of which although God doth not, for the exerciſe of their Faith, free them to their ſenſe and feeling, untill the time of their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted change; yet doth he call them by his Word and Spirit, to ſee better and better by the eye of faith, that <note place="margin">Two advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by being healed from ſin.</note> he hath perfectly healed them thereof in his own ſight, before they pray; as if he ſaid, yea I have healed thee with a twofold or double advantage, both to thee, and to me.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>my Grace</hi> (of Juſtification, which is the Mother and abundant grace, of graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 17.) <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 15, 17.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Againe, thou art not only made ſufficiently righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in my ſight: but alſo the ſecond advantage is, that hereby <hi>my power is made perfect in thy weakneſſe;</hi> that is, when thou feeleſt nothing but weakneſſe and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in thy ſelfe, then for mee notwithſtanding, to make thee <hi>ſufficiently,</hi> and <hi>perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin in my ſight freely;</hi> herein my power is mightily magnified: for if thou hadſt no ſin in thee to thy ſenſe and feeling, how couldſt thou live by faith? and how couldſt thou above thy ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bee made perfectly holy and righteous in my ſight, from that which thou haſt not? Thus it is plaine, that although God knowes the ſin that dwels in his ſanctified children, yet hee ſees them aboliſhed out of his own ſight; and ſees them ſufficiently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in his own ſight, and ſees, and defends his power to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in greatly magnified. Which wrought ſuch true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the midſt of all his infirmities, that he cryed out, that <hi>hee rejoyced in his infirmities,</hi> that this power of Chriſt in Juſtification might dwell in him, whereby hee came to feele this Miracle even of contraries to be reconciled together in him; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>when hee was weak, then was he ſtrong.</hi> Which when wee begin to feele to work in us alſo, then doe

               <p>For firſt, the time of the Law was glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1 Firſt the time of the Law.

               <p>Seventhly, God ſaw ſin in them, as their Prophets and Teachers being leſſer than <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> came not preaching and opening the Kingdome of Heaven; but he ſees none in us, as the leaſt of our Prophets and Teachers being in their Miniſtery greater then <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> doe bring us fully into the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Matth. 11. 11.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:192569:79"/> true and cleere difference in this caſe, betweene the Law and the Goſpel is not rightly diſtinguiſhed; which (as he truely proveth and experience ſhewes) brought the Goſpel of Grace into much corruption with workes, and mens conſciences into great danger; therefore is this point ſomewhat the more largely to be handled, and reduced to the purity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which is done by marking, that the cleere foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Gods Word doth diſtinguiſh croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but into two ſorts. The firſt ſort are legall <note place="margin">Two ſorts of afflictions.</note> croſſes, and the ſecond are Evangelicall croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the legall croſſes are the laſhes of the Law, <note place="margin">1 Legall.</note> and belong to ſuch perſons as are not converted, at the leaſtwiſe actively and declaratively: and as theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted perſons are of two ſorts, the Reprobate and the Elect; ſo likewiſe the uſe and operation of theſe legall croſſes is twofold, either Vindicative, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective: Vindicative are ſuch afflictions as God exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth <note place="margin">Vindicative.</note> upon the wicked and Reprobates not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but for their malicious wickedneſſe, as with flaſhes and flames of his wrath, deſtroying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding them: in which ſenſe God is called <hi>the God of vengeance, Pſal.</hi> 94. 1, 2. ſaying, <hi>O Lord God to</hi>

                  <hi>whom vengeance belongeth: O God to whom vengeance belongeth, ſhew thy ſelfe: Lift up thy ſelfe, thou judge of the earth, render a reward to the proud.</hi> But corrective afflictions are ſuch laſhes of the Law, as are executed <note place="margin">Corrective,</note> upon thoſe perſons that are the children of God by Election, but not yet converted, and ſo under the Law; and therefore thoſe afflictions are not in wrath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them, but in mercy to prepare them unto their converſion: and thus whilſt they live looſely, &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:192569:80"/> and luke-warme Laodiceans, not effectually called and converted, theſe croſſes and afflictions doe ſerve to correct them for their ſinnes; becauſe as God, whilſt they are not yet converted, ſees them in their ſins, or (which is all one) ſees ſin in them, by reaſon that they are not yet aboliſhed out of his ſight, being yet in the kingdome of darkneſſe and ſin, as the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians and ſuch others were before their converſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. So he laies croſſes and afflictions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Epheſ 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> them, as the rods and laſhes of the Law, for their ſins; that ſo they may look into the horribleneſſe and foulneſſe of them, and feeling a taſte of Gods wrath, and ſeeing their moſt fearefull danger by the ſame, may flie to Chriſt; that he by his blood may waſh away, and utterly aboliſh all their ſins out of Gods ſight, and make them <hi>perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely:</hi> which grace of Juſtification, bringing forth alſo Sanctification, truly converts them unto God. Thus the School-maſter of the Law, that held the Church of the Jewes, as little children under the rod, untill the comming of Chriſt (as is before declared) is alſo a School-maſter to drive with the laſhes of croſſes and afflictions the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Gentiles alſo unto Chriſt: and ſo is that ſaying of S. <hi>Paul</hi> common both to Jew and Gentile; <hi>That the Law is a School-maſter to drive us to Chriſt,</hi> that he may heale both our ſoules of ſinne, and our bodies <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, (I ſay) for the triall of their faith, to try them how they will ſticke to the aſſurance of this truth of God, and power of Chriſt, in this worke of the wedding garment wrought upon them by his blood; when the feeling of ſin in the fleſh, and theſe croſſes and afflictions comming as it were in the neck of the ſame would, to ſenſe and feeling, perſwade them to the cleane contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the blood of Chriſt hath not made them <hi>cleane from all ſin, 1 Iohn</hi> 1, 7. and <note place="margin">1 Iohn 1, 7.</note> that Chriſt hath not made them <hi>perfectly holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely:</hi> unto which temptation if we yeeld, what is this but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt and his blood?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſerve to exerciſe, encreaſe, make <note place="margin">2 To exerciſe and encreaſe our faith.</note> ſtrong, and to give us an experimentall feeling in our ſelves of that faith, that hath made us <hi>perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely.</hi> For it is true that the faith of Gods children is weak, and will ſometimes ſtagger and droope; and their ſanctification will be like the Moone, as it were, in the wane, and faile as <hi>Abrahams</hi> did ſometimes; but becauſe they are <hi>cloathed with the Sun</hi> (as ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewed hereafter in the ſecond part of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:192569:82"/> that is, becauſe the wedding garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe wherewith they are cloathed never failes them; therefore although the ſaid weakneſſe of their faith, and other imperfections of their ſanctification be covered and utterly aboliſhed from before God, with the perfection of Chriſts faith, and compleat ſanctification, wherewith they are cloathed, and thus being tranſlated into Chriſt they ſtill abide <hi>compleat in the ſight of God, Coloſ.</hi> 2. 10.

Hence of this ſecond ſort of afflictions doe ariſe farre greater prayſes, than of the firſt ſort: as that they faſhion us like to the Image of Chriſt, that they are more precious than gold; that they manifeſt and declare the rich graces wrought in us by Juſtification and the ſpirit of God.

And <hi>this hope makes us not aſhamed,</hi> that is, ſhall not be fruſtrated; becauſe the love of God in juſtifying us with his Sons blood, being thus experimentally powred abroad into our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt, aſſureth us that <hi>if hee ſpared not his own Son, when wee were ſinners,</hi> to juſtifie us, <hi>much more</hi> being now juſtified, that is, no ſinners in his ſight, <hi>will hee with him, give us all things alſo, Rom.</hi> 8. 32.

               <p>As firſt, not a true and <hi>right dividing of the word of God,</hi> by reſerving and applying the Law and the Goſpel to their due, right, and proper objects to whom they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:192569:87"/> rightly belong in the congregation; as to apply the Law, and meerly nothing but the killing Law, and that alſo in his full vigour and force to the looſe, careleſſe, and ſecure ones in the leaſt ſin, to whom the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; untill they be terrified with the horribleneſſe of the leaſt ſin in the ſight of God: And on the other ſide to apply the Goſpel, and meerly nothing but the healing and quickning Goſpel, to the humbled and terrified ones, to whom only the Goſpel belongs, to raiſe them up to joy, love, and zeale of glorifying God <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 12. Mark 2. 11, 12. <hi>Luth. in</hi> Galat. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 19.</note> for the ſame, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 12. Mark 2. 11, 12.</hi> whereupon the ſaying of <hi>Luther</hi> is moſt true; That <hi>unleſſe the Goſpel be thus plainly diſcerned, and in practiſe diſtinguiſhed from the Law, the true Chriſtian doctrine cannot be kept ſound and uncorrupt: But contrariwiſe, if this difference be known (and kept) then is alſo the true manner of Iuſtification truly known and kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to tell theſe humbled ones terrified with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> horribleneſſe of the leaſt ſin, and now by juſtification made glad, joyfull, and zealous, that they are not made perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely, but that God doth ſee their foule ſins in them, and is ready to correct and puniſh them for the ſame, is to pull off againe the wedding garment, and to put upon them a mourning garment of blowes, and beating in the marriage feaſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 2. and <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 2.</note> to make the children of God, or rather Spouſe of Chriſt, not to have on the wedding garment in the marriage feaſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. <note place="margin">Verſe 11. 12. 3</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, not feeling how powerfull the treaſures of the Goſpel alone are, both to aboliſh all ſin from before God, and by joy and zeale thereof to mortifie all ſin in our ſelves, they goe to borrow helpe by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:192569:87"/> feare from the whippings of the Law; as if the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that kils the old man, and makes us alive, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us up from the ſpirituall death to life, were not able to encreaſe that life begun, and ſufficient to bury the old man utterly, except it borrowed helpe of the whippings of the Law; and ſo make a miſcillane and mixture of the Law and Goſpel; and thus preach (as <hi>Luther</hi> truely ſaith) neither true Law not true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but a miſcillane and marring of both; and thereby make miſcillane Chriſtians, that is meere hypocrites, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 25. <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 4. 25. 4</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this mixture and mingling of whipping to righteouſneſſe joyned with <hi>free juſtification</hi> in the faithfull, as <hi>Luther</hi> truely ſaith upon theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. They intend to pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt, Gal. 1. 7. The preachers of the Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>become</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Galat. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Apoſtles of the Devill;</hi> becauſe this mingling doth not only blemiſh and darken the knowledge of Grace, but alſo it taketh away Chriſt, with all his benefits, and it ſecretly undermines, and utterly overthrowes the Goſpel. And yet (ſaith he) <hi>ſuch perverters of the Goſpel, can abide nothing leſſe, than to heare that they are the Apoſtles of the Devill;</hi> nay rather they glory above others in the Name of Chriſt, and boaſt themſelves to be the moſt ſincere preachers of the Goſpel; but becauſe they mingle the Law with the Goſpel (as if one ſhould mingle blacke and white and marre both, and ſo darken Grace) they muſt needs be perverters of the Goſpel: becauſe</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they deny Chriſt to have by himſelfe alone made us whole, that is, <hi>perfectly holy and righteous from</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                  <hi>all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely;</hi> for all the Devills in hell cannot deny, but that looke how much ſinne
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:192569:88"/> God ſees in us, and whips us for the ſame, ſo much doe we come ſhort of being of unjuſt made juſt, that is, <hi>perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, they blemiſh and extenuate the glory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> perfect Reconciliation, In that they grant, that wee are ſo reconciled to God by Chriſt, that God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Father; but they paint him out like an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Father, everſeeing ſin in us, and ever ſtanding with a rod or ſtaffe in his hand lifted up over our heads; with which by reaſon that he ever ſeeth ſome fault and blame in us, he is ever ready, not to ſtrike us down, yet to crack our crownes, and ſorely to whip us, and to be-cudgel us throughly; whereas the Goſpel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes him to be not only become our <hi>loving Father,</hi> but alſo our <hi>well pleaſed Father,</hi> at perfect peace, and perfect reconciliation with us, ſo perfectly ſatisfied by Chriſt, that <hi>we have not one ſpot or wrinkle of ſin, or any ſuch thing in his ſight freely, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 27. and thereby <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>are without all fault, and without all blame, and reproofe in his ſight</hi> (as the originall words import, Col. 1. 22.) <note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. 22. verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If we continue rooted and ſtabliſhed in this faith, verſ.</hi> 23. But alas, here we are ſo far from being grounded and ſtabliſhed in this faith, that we loſe not theſe benefits (as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) by wavering; but by wrangling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and gaine-ſaying them, we caſt them quite away: but how farre more Evangelically doth a right Reverend Divine indeed, as it were with one ſtroke <note place="margin">B. <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:192569:88"/> 
                  <hi>Ejus quod non est, non eſt poena; Peccatum remiſſum non eſt, Iohn 1. 29. Ergo peccati remiſsi non eſt poena.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 29.</note> That is, of that which is not, there is no temporall puniſhment, correction, or paine: Forgiven ſin is not, or hath no being before God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 29. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of forgiven ſinne there is no temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, this mingling of the Law and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> &amp; ſaying that God ſees ſin in his juſtified children to correct and puniſh them for the ſame, muſt needs trouble the conſciences of Gods children (except they be hypocrites) exceedingly: becauſe the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a loving Father have ſome reſpect to the hainouſneſſe of the fault committed, and correcteth accordingly: therefore ſeeing the leaſt ſin is ſo infinite an horrible thing in the ſight of God, ſo infinitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted of him; that if for one ſmall motion of ſinne, but meerely to chaſtiſe and correct us for it, he ſhould lay us in hell fire, and there let us lye a thouſand yeares, and afterwards deliver us; any man may ſee if he be not an hypocrite in the ſight of ſin, that it were but a moderate and ſmall correction for one ſin, if it be but the coldneſſe or ſpice of vaine-glory in one good worke; much more then, if a man be not a groſſe hypocrite, to count his many ſins, to be corrected, very ſmall; how can hee chuſe but feare and looke every houre for moſt horrible temporall plagues meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to correct, and yet in mercy to chaſtiſe him for all his innumerable horrible ſins, that God ſees in in him? but theſe <hi>miſcillane Chriſtians</hi> never knew what an horrible thing the leaſt motion of ſin is in the ſight of God, and therefore feare not horrible corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for them, untill they come for dallying with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:192569:89"/> Gods Juſtice, and for their unbeliefe, and robbing of Chriſt of the glory of the <hi>chaſtiſement of our peace, Eſay 53. 5.</hi> to beare it themſelves, they come to bee <note place="margin">Eſay 53. 5.</note> chaſtiſed and corrected in hell, where, I dare warrant them, they ſhall have correction enough, and nothing but juſt and due correction for their ſins.</p>
               <p>Eightly, whilſt the light of nature and reaſon thinks to provide the better, &amp; greatly to further the care and diligence of holy walking, with fear of corrections and whippings and laſhes of croſſes and afflictions (which fleſhly and Papiſtical wiſedome is the very kore of this ſoare) ſhe doth indeed greatly hinder true ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Evangelicall true Repentance, and holy walking both in the whole, and in the parts of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the whole moſt evidently; for ſeeing the leaſt ſin is the plague-ſoare of the ſoule, making us ſick, and unable to doe any ſpirituall duty, pining away even unto the death of hell, and nothing can heale us of the ſame, but <hi>free justification,</hi> by making us by the blood of Chriſt <hi>perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely: and thus by his ſtripes wee are healed,</hi> and truely made whole, <hi>Eſay 53. 5.</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Eſay 53. 5.</note> ſanctification is but the lively ſtirring about, that comes of this healing by juſtification, can we then ſtirre lively in the duties of ſanctification, before wee feele our ſelves healed of the deadly ſickneſſe of our ſins, by Juſtification? was <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious towards the true God, ſo loving to the Prophet, ſo meeke, gentle, and liberall to his ſervant, before he felt himſelfe freely healed of his Leproſie? and ſhall not the perfect healing of us from all ſin (a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe Leproſie) doe the ſame much more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:192569:89"/> in us, when we are once come to ſee by faith how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous we are made from all ſpot of ſin, the ſpirituall Leproſie, in the ſight of God freely, and that alſo not in the water of <hi>Iordan,</hi> but in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the blood of Chriſt? Againe did the ſinfull woman in the Goſpel waſh in true Repentance the feet of Jeſus Chriſt with her teares, and kiſſe them ſo often in ſuch love, untill by perceiving that much both for matter, manner, and meaſure was forgiven her, ſhe loved much? <hi>Luke 7. 47.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for the parts of ſanctification and Repentance, <note place="margin">Luke 7, 47. Two parts of ſanctification. 1 Mo tifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and firſt mortification: ſeeing the leaſt motions of ſin, even in thought only are ſuch horrible poiſon of hell, ſo poiſoning us, and all our holy walking of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification that (as Chriſt ſaith) they defile all unto damnation: when we ſee that nothing can make us ſpiritually clean from them, except the Son of God be killed to temper for us, with his blood, ſo precious an Antidote or confection, as is juſtification, only able to make us myſtically perfectly holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from them all in the ſight of God; and ſo firſt makes our inſide of our cup even of our mindes and conſciences paſſively pure and clean in the ſight of God freely, <hi>Titus 1. 15.</hi> or elſe theſe wormes of our ſoules, <note place="margin">Titus 2. 15.</note> even the very ſtirring motions only will as truely and certainely kill us, as they killed Chriſt? doe we not then begin to ſee in the ſtreame of Chriſts blood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing us from them, the vileneſſe of theſe evill thoughts, and leaſts motions, and begin to hate them, as the venemous vipers of our ſoule, either eating out our heart, or the heart of Chriſt Jeſus? and thus hating the evill thoughts and firſt motions of ſin, doth not this make us much more to hate and crucifie the groſſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:192569:90"/> acts, and outward practiſes of the ſame?

Did the tenth Leper returne with ſuch joy, did hee praiſe God with ſuch a loud voice, and did hee fall downe and worſhip Chriſt ſo fervently before he felt himſelfe healed of his Leproſie? which was (as the learned ſhewes) a true tipe and figure of our <hi>free juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi>

Thus we ſee how the leſſening of the glory of our juſtification extinguiſheth the vigour of our ſanctification, both hindering our joy, leſſening our love, and quenching our zeale, that otherwiſe, by the exceeding greatneſſe of Chriſts benefits, would exceedingly abound, <hi>Eſay 61. 3.

               <p>Ninthly, this Doctrine that God ſees ſin in his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied children, to correct and puniſh them for the ſame, expells the filiall feare, and brings in the ſlaviſh and ſervile feare, and makes his children to ſerve him with eye-ſervice; for whereas the filiall feare is to avoide the evill that the childe knowes to diſlike and diſpleaſe his father, and to doe the good that pleaſeth and liketh him; not for feare of blowes, puniſhment, and beating, if his father ſhould ſee him, but with a ſingle eye, like nature, loving inclination, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection of love and reverence, though his Father
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:192569:90"/> neither ſaw him, nor would puniſh him for the ſame. But on the other ſide, the ſervile feare, looks only to the maſters eye, and avoydeth evill doing, and doth the commanded good duties either for his wages, or for feare of blowes and beating; whilſt it is not marked, that this filiall feare is by the fall, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature loſt in naturall children, whereby their Parents are conſtrained to uſe the ſervile feare, and to drive their children from evill, and to doe their duties, with blowes, corrections, and beatings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſerve them not onely with much eye-ſervice, but alſo very aukwardly oftentimes: When wee Preachers doe neglect to ground in the peoples hearts, great joy for the greatneſſe of the free-given treaſures of Chriſt, that ſhould work and cauſe this filiall feare, loving inclination, and dutifull, and truly filiall affections; and goe about to ſquare Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, according to the corrupt pattern of naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, corrupted with the ſlaviſh feare, with blowes and beatings: wee muſt needs quench in them the true fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall feare, and ſtabliſh in them the ſervile feare that ſhould be caſt out, 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 18.</hi> &amp; cauſe in the children <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 18.</note> of God, this eye-ſervice, which if it be naught in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſervants to their earthly maſters (as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Epheſ. 6. 6.)</hi> how abhominable is it much more in <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 6.</note> the children of God, to their heavenly Father, and makes but hypocrites?</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:192569:93"/> objections againſt our aſſurance by faith, that our ſinnes are forgiven, ſaying thus, If your faith be an aſſurance that your ſins are forgiven, what need you daily to pray to God to forgive you your treſpaſſes? for this were needleſſe, if we were before aſſured of pardon, and ſalvation. Now becauſe this matter of prayer is an exceeding weighty point (for what can be more weighty than a right acceptable prayer in the ſight of God?) therefore is this point the more fully to be handled; and ſo much the more, becauſe theſe Objectors would, by theſe objections, give an appearance that they never yet made a good prayer to God: and no marvell, becauſe as it is an eaſie matter to pray, and that ſometimes earneſtly by the light of nature; ſo it is an hard matter and rare to pray rightly by the light of grace.

               <p>Firſt, if we have by the unchangeable nature and truth of God revealed in that ſentence, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> and by the death of Chriſt, ſuch a true ſight above the Gentiles, what an infinite horrible thing the leaſt ſinne is in the ſight of God, that we dare not (as the Gentiles did, and men in the light of nature ſtill doe) preſſe, and ruſh into the preſence and ſight of God in the leaſt ſinne, and ſo give him the true glory of his juſtice: Becauſe (as the firſt Proteſtant Diſpenſers of Gods myſteries, that rightly make the juſtifying faith the firſt entry unto God) doe truly ſay; if he be juſtly condemned of the contempt of his Princes majeſty, that dares preſſe into his ſight and preſence defiled with foule, filthy, and loathſome dung, that is exceeding loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in his Princes ſight: how much more is he to be condemned of filthy hypocriſie in the ſight of ſin,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:192569:94"/> that dares preſſe and enter into the ſight and preſence of God, foule with the leaſt ſin in him and upon him, that is a thouſand times more filthy and loathſome in the ſight of God, than the loathſomeſt dung that can be, to the eyes of a Prince: and ſo rob God of the glory of his juſtice, and infinite hatred of the leaſt ſinne?</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he may not (as hereby juſtly hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> might) run away, with <hi>Adam,</hi> from God, and from <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8.</note> prayer, he muſt, in his prayers, come in ſome faith, hope, and comfort of his Baptiſme; wherein God ſaid unto him in the power of his owne ordinance, <hi>Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſinnes in calling upon the name of the Lord Ieſus, Acts</hi> 22. 16. for when <note place="margin">Acts 22. 16.</note> a Chriſtian feeles himſelfe fallen into ſome ſin, as the only meanes to raiſe him up againe, muſt be to returne by faith unto the efficacy of his Baptiſme, by conſidering the horribleneſſe of the leaſt ſinne, that he being an infant, could not be admitted into the favour of God, and fellowſhip of his Church and children, except he were firſt waſhed from all his ſins: and then conſiders how freely, when he was not able in his infancy to ſend up one groane, or ſigh unto God for his originall filth, not to think a good thought of God; yet even then to ſave him freely, Chriſt opened his ſide, and poured out upon him his heart blood, to waſh away all his ſins paſt, preſent and to come; and cloathing him with the wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne righteouſneſſe, did ſeale the ſame up unto him to put him out of all doubt thereof, by his oath, and owne ſeale of Baptiſme; and therefore now ſighing up to Chriſt in the ſenſe and feeling of his ſins, may be much more aſſured, that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:192569:94"/> his grace ſo freely begunne unto him; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus found firſt of Chriſt before we ſought after him, he will preſerve us ſtill in that his wedding garment from all ſin in his fathers ſight continually and for ever: for whom he once juſtifieth, he juſtifieth for ever, becauſe (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14.) <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee hath with one ſacrifice upon the croſſe made perfect</hi> by juſtification to the ſight of God, continually, and <hi>for ever, all them that be ſanctified:</hi> wherewith notably agrees that witneſſe of a learned diſpenſer of Gods myſteries, ſaying, <hi>That we ought to know that at what time</hi>

                  <hi>ſoever we be baptized, we are at once waſhed and made cleane for all our life; therefore ſo oft as we fall We muſt goe back to the remembrance of baptiſme, and therewith we muſt arme our minde, that it may alway be certaine and aſſured of the forgiveneſſe of ſins; for though when it is once mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred it ſeemeth to be paſt, yet by following ſins it is not aboliſhed; for the cleanneſs of Chriſt is therin beſtowed upon us, that alway flouriſheth, is oppreſſed with no ſpots, but overwhelmeth and wipeth away all our filthineſſe,</hi> and ſo preſerveth us in perfect righteouſneſſe to Godward for ever: as this (I ſay) is the only meanes whereby after our falls we returne unto him; his waſhing us thus in his blood firſt, making us to waſh our ſelves declaratively in teares of love and Evangelicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſo is it the only meanes to come rightly unto God in prayer: thus we come in the wedding garment: thus we come rightly <hi>in the name and power of Chriſts blood that we were baptized in:</hi> thus our prayer is <hi>the prayer of a righteous man that prevaileth much with God:</hi> thus we come in faith, wherein St. <hi>Iames</hi> bids us not to waver, for then we rob the blood of Chriſt of his glory in us, &amp; then we obtain nothing of the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:192569:95"/>
               <p>Whereby we ſee that they that will preſſe by prayer into the preſence of God, foule in their ſin, untill they have obtained pardon by prayer, doe faile both in the firſt point of right comming, not knowing the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of ſin revealed in the Word, &amp; have but a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſh conceit of the foulneſs of it, &amp; ſo are ready with the Gentiles and Papiſts to make their prayers to be, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or in the name of Chriſt, <hi>ex Condigno,</hi> the meanes of the pardon of their ſins.

               <p>THe third Reaſon objected is this, The holy Ghoſt <note place="margin">Third Reaſon Objected.</note> is God, and ſhewes us our ſinnes: and ſhall not hee being God, and ſhewing us our ſins, much more know and ſee ſin in his juſtified children? <hi>ergo,</hi> the children of God are not made by Chriſts wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment, ſo perfectly holy and righteous, that they have not one ſpot or wrinkle in the ſight of God freely.</p>

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> and to ſee the unchangable truth of this definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that <hi>Heaven and Earth may paſſe away, but one jot or tittle of this ſentence cannot paſſe, untill it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> and to ſee the horribleneſſe of Gods curſe due to the leaſt ſin: thus the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhewes us our ſins, whereby they begin to ſee their Leproſie to bee very foule, and their miſerie moſt fearefull for one ſinne, much more for many ſinnes; whereby they are ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and ſo effectually humbled, that they deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more between heaven and Earth, than to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of this their deadly Leptoſie, and helliſh poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the leſt ſin: this is the holy Ghoſts, and not the light of natures, firſt ſhewing us our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Now when this firſt work is thus wrought: then the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:192569:99"/> ſpirit wils his Miniſters to hold forth, likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly before their faces the glaſſe of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they hear that nothing can heale them of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Leproſie and wofull miſerie, but the blood of the Son of God, which they apprehending, the ſpirit alſo doth by imputation cloath them with the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment of Chriſts righteouſueſſe, wherewith he aboliſheth, firſt out of his own ſight all their ſinnes, and then gives them the eye of faith, whereby they alſo ſee their ſins utterly aboliſhed out of the ſight of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, one God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:192569:109"/> things not appearing; therefore that faith may have place, it is neceſſary that all things which are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be hid; but they cannot be more deeply hid than under the contrary object, ſenſe, and experience: But when as we ſee all our ſinnes laid upon Chriſt, and to be victoriouſly conquered of him by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and doe confidently beleeve this; then they are dead, and brought to nothing; for being laid upon Chriſt, they muſt not remaine ſo, but are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the triumph of his reſurrection.</q> So ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Chriſt was delivered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our Iuſtification;</hi> that is, by his death he hath taken upon him our ſins, and thereby utterly aboliſhed them out of the ſight of God, as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames aboliſh darkneſſe, and by his reſurrection hath made us perfectly righteous; ſo that a true Chriſtian may be bold to ſay, Lord God, maker of the whole world, it is true that I feele ſinnes in my ſelfe, but through Chriſt, that hath taken them away out of thy ſight, I am certaine that I am perfectly righteous, good, and holy before thee, &amp;c. for of theſe things muſt a ſincere Chriſtian be partaker, and of theſe things he ought to glory, if he bee a true Chriſtian; and he that cannot glory of theſe things, is not yet a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>THe ſecond ſpirituall weapon to overcome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2 The ſecond ſpirituall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon againſt deubting.</note> is, that whereas our reaſon, ſenſe, ſight, and feeling are our ſtrongeſt enimies; not only to drive us into doubting; but alſo ſight, by ſaying, I ſee ſinne in me, and ſenſe, by truly ſaying, I feele ſinne in me, and reaſon by ſaying, it is impoſſible but this ſhould make me foule in the ſight of God, will thus ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:192569:109"/> us, that wee are not made perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely: wee muſt mark out of the former deſcription, that it is the very nature, heart, and eſſence of faith to mortifie theſe enimies, and to tell them, that they are all lying ſophiſters, of true principles aſſuming falſe inferences, and to beleeve the cleane contrary to them; becauſe God and the blood of Chriſt do aſſure us the contrary, namely, that we ſeeing by the light of Gods word, that one ſpot of ſinne makes us in the ſight of God foule, like the Devill, and accurſed, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 10. the blood of Chriſt doth make us ſo <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> cleane, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. that we are whiter than ſnow, <note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 7.

                  <hi>Canaan)</hi> God himſelfe, and all creatures pretend otherwiſe than the word ſpeaketh: thus <hi>Sarah</hi> ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the firſt, yet at length got the victory over her doubting, by forgetting her barrenneſſe, and old age, that pretended impoſſibility, and by judging him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that had ſpoken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 11. And thus doth faith <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11.</note> make a man ſhut his eyes againſt what he ſees, and ſeeles in himſelfe, and doth bore his eares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 6.</note> to heare what God ſpeaketh. Becauſe it is moſt true that <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, That this is the chiefe virtue, and cunning of faith, that it ſeeth thoſe things that are not
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:192569:110"/> ſeene or felt; and ſeeth not thoſe things, which are felt, yea which are now ſore upon us, and doe preſſe and urge us. As on the contrary ſide, diffidence and unbeleefe ſeeth nothing, but that which it feeleth agreeing with naturall reaſon, neither can it reſt upon any other thing, but that which it feeleth.</p>
               <p>But faith ſaith otherwiſe, it reſteth only in the word, and truſteth wholly unto it; neither doubteth it that any thing will fall out otherwiſe than the word ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. This is a right and ſtrong faith, when as a man leaveth ſenſe, wiſedome, reaſon, and truſteth wholly to the word of God.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe thoſe things are of God laid upon faith to overcome them, which the whole world is not able to beare, as ſinnes, death, the world, and the Devill; neither doth God ſuffer it to be occupied with ſmall matters.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this right faith thus truſting to, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the teſtimony of the word of God, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and firmely beleeve things to nature impoſſible, and therefore incredible to humane reaſon; and yet firmely beleeves them, meerely conſidering the truth and power of God, ſpeaking, calling and thereby effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame.</p>
               <p>For faith ſaith, I beleeve thee, O God, when thou ſpeakeſt; and what ſaith God? impoſſible things, lies, fooliſh, weak, abſurd, abhominable, hereticall, and devilliſh things, if thou beleeve reaſon.</p>
               <p>For reaſon doth not underſtand, that to heare the word of God, and to beleeve it, is the chiefeſt ſervice that God requireth of us: but when God ſpeaketh, reaſon judgeth his word to be hereſie, and the word of the Devill; for becauſe it is againſt reaſon, it ſeemeth
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:192569:110"/> unto it abſurd and fooliſh.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> killed reaſon by faith in the word of God, whereby ſeed was promiſed to him of <hi>Sarah,</hi> who was barren, and now alſo paſt child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: unto this word reaſon yeelded not ſtraitway in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet bore more ſway in <hi>Zacharie;</hi> but it fought againſt faith even in him, both he and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Sarah</hi> judging it to be an abſurd, a fooliſh, and impoſſible thing, that <hi>Sarah</hi> who was now not only ninety yeeres old, but alſo was barren by nature, ſhould bring forth a ſonne. Thus faith wreſtled with reaſon in <hi>Abraham;</hi> but herein faith got the victory, killed and ſacrificed reaſon, that moſt cruell, and peſtilent enimy of God, and gave glory to God.</p>
               <p>So all the godly entring with <hi>Abraham</hi> into the darkneſſe of faith; when feeling, and reaſon would perſwade them that they are not cleane from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God, they crucifie feeling, and kill reaſon, ſaying, reaſon, thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, becauſe although Satan hath not been able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> extinguiſh the virtue and power of Baptiſme to little infants; yet he labours with all might and maine to extinguiſh it in elder folk, and hath ſo farre prevailed herein, that where are there almoſt any that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the glory of their Baptiſme? and feele joy in the truth of the foure former points? much leſſe doe they glory in this great glory of the Lord ſealed upon them, mentioned, <hi>Eſay</hi> 60. 2. but look after other <note place="margin">Eſay 60. 2.</note> meanes of aſſuring themſelves of the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes, and after other wayes of comming to heaven.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:192569:118"/> upon the meere truth of God, freely promiſing it, and ſo fled from her. And this point have I the more largely proſecuted, becauſe although it be an high point of magnifying Gods truth, and the ſole glory of Chriſt, and the right honouring of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme, and the next meanes of raiſing us up to the true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Evangelicall repentance, and right zeale of Gods glory; yet it is of us too little practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:192569:118"/> tongues to contradict, to gaine-ſay, wrangle againſt, and oppugne the ſame, with all might and maine poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can. But againſt this ſcandall we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently forewarned, and thereby ſtrongly fore-armed with that one watch-word of the holy Ghoſt, ſaying, That Chriſt brings the moſt certaine teſtimony of himſelfe and of his benefits, from his Father, <hi>but no man receiveth his teſtimony, Iohn</hi> 3. 32. which (as the <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 32.</note> learned interpreters doe well expreſſe) muſt not bee ſo underſtood, as if no man at all doth receive Chriſts teſtimony (ſeeing both the Apoſtles, and many others beleeving, have, and daily doe receive the ſame) but becauſe very few in compariſon doe receive it, who if they bee compared with the huge multitude that make a ſhew of receiving it, by the dead faith, but in truth doe not, doe appeare to be in a manner, none. Indeed almoſt all doe profeſſe that they doe beleeve, and doe think in a generall confuſed manner, that they doe receive Chriſt, and his benefits; ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> himſelfe could not ſee the day of Chriſt more <note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> cleerly than they doe, ſaying and thinking by the dead faith, <hi>I am rich, and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, when they know not, that they are wretched, and miſerable, and poore and blinde, and naked, Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 17.</note> this is not to receive Chriſt, and the rich benefits teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him, but only to dreame that we have received <note place="margin">To receive Chriſt truly includeth four things.</note> Chriſt; but to receive Chriſt, and his benefits truly, doth neceſſarily include in it theſe foure particular points.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to know the time when wee were without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt, and had him not, therein feeling our miſery and our loſt ſtate by the leaſt ſinne, and what need we had to receive him.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:192569:119"/>
               <p>Secondly, to ſee the excellency and worth of having Chriſt and his benefits, how worthy they are to bee received and retained; for no man will take, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly receive that which he ſees to be little worth, except it be for cuſtome, and faſhion ſake, becauſe all men do ſo, with whom we live: <hi>Aeſops</hi> cock con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelfe with a barley corne, neglecting a pearle, becauſe he knowes not the worth of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it imports an having of Chriſt and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> benefits to ones owne ſelfe in particular; for he that receives a thing and that alſo to himſelfe, doth take it to his owne ſelfe, and ſo hath and enjoyes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, uſe, and benefit of it to himſelfe in particular: as when a ſick man hath received a cordiall of his Phyſitian, hee hath it within him, there working ſtrength, health, and livelineſſe in himſelfe, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, he that hath received to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the enjoying of Chriſt, and his benefits, of ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> excellent worth, is filled with great joy, according to the excellency of the things received, and becomes to the giver of the ſame full of thankfull zeale, highly prizing them according to the worth of them, above all other things whatſoever: all which is evident by the teſtimony of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>The Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (that is, the true enjoying of Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits) <hi>is like a treaſure hid in the field, which when a man hath found, he hideth it, and for joy thereof goes and ſells</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>all that he hath, and buyeth that field:</hi> But alas, how few are there at this day that doe thus? and therefore how few have found this treaſure? how few receive and conſider this very teſtimony of Chriſt? may we not well ſay, in a manner none? but what is the kore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:192569:119"/> of this ſore? even this, becauſe it is a difficult and hard matter to beleeve with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the excellency of the things that God ſpeaketh contrary to our ſenſe, ſight, and feeling, and to reaſon builded upon the ſame; and therefore the paradoxes and myſteries of Chriſt muſt be wreſted to agree with reaſon, or elſe the <hi>world,</hi> that is, the <hi>greateſt multitude</hi> will be ſo farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <note place="margin">With what cunning Chriſts is by many rejected.</note> them, that they will utterly reject them. But how, and after what manner will they dare to reject Chriſt and his benefits? even with a threefold cunning device:</p>
               <p>Firſt, to palliate their unbeleefe; for we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they are no unbeleevers of any old ancient truth; therefore although God himſelfe, <hi>the ancient of daies,</hi> hath ſpoken it, and hath the unanimous teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Orthodox Interpreters and Diſpenſers of Gods myſteries, yet it muſt beare the title firſt of <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> and then it is enough to reject; ſo when Chriſt came a Miniſter of the old and ancient truth of God, but <hi>to confirme the promiſes made of old unto the Fathers, Rom.</hi> 15. 8. yet when he began to preach <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> the ſame, the greateſt multitude cried out, <hi>what new Doctrine is this? Marke</hi> 1. 17. whereupon it is moſt <note place="margin">Mark. 1, 17.</note> true, that is teſtified by the Apologie of the Church of England, ſaying, <hi>We wot not by what meanes, but wee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Part 5.</note> 
                  <hi>have ever ſeene it come to paſſe from the firſt beginning, that as often as God did give but ſome light to any people, and open his truth unto men, though the truth were not only of greateſt antiquity, but alſo from everlaſting; yet of the foreſaid greateſt multitude it was called newfangled, and of late deviſed.</hi> Yea, <hi>Euſebius writeth that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>

                  </gap>, that is to ſay, New and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:192569:120"/> ſtrange. But as Chriſt unto the Scribes and Phariſees objecting, that he brought in a certaine new Religion, ſaid, <hi>If ye beleeved Moſes, ye would beleeve me alſo:</hi> So it may be anſwered to theſe, that if they beleeved the excellency of <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> they would not ſtumble at the ſaying of the Scriptures, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of the learned Interpreters, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Their next manner of rejecting the benefits of the Goſpel is, That going about to meaſure them by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, and finding that reaſon agrees with them no righter than a Rammes horne; that Reaſon may not leeſe her glory, no fault muſt be found with Lady Reaſon; but Chriſts benefits muſt beare the blame, namely, that they are fooliſh and abſurd, and ſo <note place="margin">The Goſpell is fooliſhneſſe to Reaſon.</note> fooliſh and abſurd things are not to be received of ſuch wiſe men as the whole world is: theſe little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, and leſſe regarding to lay the blame where it is, namely, That <hi>the naturall man not only perceives not the things of Gods ſpirit, but they are alſo fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto him, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14. but leaſt of all practiſing <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> that admonition of the Apoſtle, <hi>That if any man will be wiſe, let him become a foole, that he may be wiſe, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. but this is an hard ſaying to ſuch wiſe heads: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 18.</note> who can heare it?</p>
               <p>Then thirdly, when they have concluded of Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, that they are not only ſtrange, but alſo <hi>fooliſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> leſt they ſhould be blamed of unbeleefe, they think it the beſt, to ſharpen the uttermoſt of their wits by contradicting, ſophiſticating, wrangling, gaine-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; eſpecially by abſurd calumnious conſequents of their own collections &amp; hatchings, as with meer <hi>Nioc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall</hi> concluſions, yea and by mockings, jeſtings and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:192569:120"/> deridings, utterly to beat it down. But weighty is that admonition of our Church taught by the firſt Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpel in this Land, ſaying, <hi>The worldly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doctrine of our Church.</note> 
                  <hi>wiſemen ſcorne the Doctrine of Chriſt, as fooliſh to their underſtandings:</hi> yea, will ſome ſay, to ſome of that blinde time; nay ſay the foreſaid faithfull witneſſes, <q>Theſe ſcorners have ever beene, and ever wil be to the end of the world: And therefore let us that have one ſparke of the true feare of God, if we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſenſe and reaſon of the ſayings of the holy Scriptures, yet let us not be ſcorners, jeſters, and deriders, for that is the uttermoſt token and ſhew of a Reprobate, of a plaine enimy to God and his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c.

               <p>Firſt, the ſpirituall knowledge apprehends the things which neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor heart of naturall man can conceive; that is, it conceives the myſteries of God above reaſon, yea, and contrary to naturall reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling; but the literall knowledge apprehends not the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, but after a carnall manner, as they are new-faſhioned, as it were, and made agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſenſe, and feeling; and hence come ſo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections from reaſon, ſenſe, and feeling.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, the literall knowledge being <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Fifthly, the literall knowledge although it bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſo great, doth not change him that is in it: but leaves him in his former old nature, and corrupt converſation: as if he were prophane, it leaves him ſtill prophane: if he were meerely civill honeſt, it leaves him ſtill meerely civill honeſt; if he were blindly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous with a legall zeale, it leaves him ſtill blindly zealous with a legall zeale, of advancing works, works and doing: as wee may ſee by the example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who before his converſion, <hi>followed the righteouſnes of the Law, Rom. 9. 31. and was zealous towards God, Act.</hi>

Indeed, they lay the blame and fault in our doctrine, when they themſelves are the authors of theſe troubles and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But becauſe they are perſwaded by this literall knowledge, that they perſecute that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and but meere fooliſhneſſe, they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this, that they are the authors of theſe troubles; and much leſſe can they beleeve, that it is they which murmur, riſe up, and take counſell againſt the Lord, and his annoynted: nay rather they think that they maintaine the Lords cauſe, that they defend his glory, and doe him acceptable ſervice in perſecuting us. The reaſon whereof is this (expreſſed by <hi>Luther</hi> in other places upon the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſpeaking againſt vaine-glory, and therefore as worthy the often reading as the former, the ſumme alſo whereof is thus:) <hi>That ſuch is the nature of theſe literall and vaine-glorious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Satan, That they can make a goodly ſhew, that they are very charitable, humble, lovers of concord, and are indued with all other fruites of the Spirit; alſo they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:192569:135"/> proteſt, that they ſeek nothing elſe but the glory of God, and the ſalvation of mens ſouls; and yet, being full of vaine-glory, and doing all things to ſeeme learned and godly, and ſo to get praiſe and eſtimation among men, they doe nothing elſe, but with their cavills, ſophiſticating, and</hi> calumniations under a colour of cleering the truth, <hi>paint over, and hide their own ignorance, bemuddy the cleer truth, diſquiet the minds of the ſimple, and trouble mens conſciences, and ſo are the true and proper authors of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention and ſects. And this</hi> Paul <hi>complained of, not only reſpecting the preſent times, but alſo foreſaw in ſpirit that there ſhould bee an infinite number of ſuch in the Church; even to the Worlds end: for when God ſendeth faithfull labourers into his harveſt, by and by Satan raiſeth up his miniſters alſo, who will in no caſe bee counted inferiour to thoſe that are rightly called; here ſtraightwaies riſeth diſſention; the wicked will not yeeld one haires-bredth to the godly: for they take themſelves, that they far paſſe them, in wit, in learning, in godlineſſe, in ſpirit, and in all other vertues.

               <p>Firſt, by doubting whether we be made in the ſight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of God cleane from all our ſins, we make God a liar, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>he that beleeveth not God, hath made him a liar;</hi> becauſe God teſtifying in his word, that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne doth make us in his ſight ſo cleane from all ſin, that we are

               <p>Thirdly, by the ſame reaſon, we make God a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> mocker, and a deceiver of us; if God outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie this perfect waſhing away, and making of us cleane from all ſpot of ſin in his owne ſight freely, by his owne-invented ſigne of waſhing by water of Baptiſme, and thereby to ſeale unto us the operation of his Sons blood effecting the ſame; yet wee doubt that hee doth not performe the truth of all this upon us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by the ſame reaſon, we rob him, in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſelves, of the praiſe and glory of his almighty power, if we doubt that we are not made perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in his ſight, for any unlikely-hood thereof, by reaſon of the ſinne that we

               <p>Fifthly, by the ſame reaſon, wee rob him in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſelves of the praiſe and glory of his perfect juſtice; that ſhines forth more in undertaking with his Sons righteouſneſſe to make us perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſinne in his owne ſight freely; than if we had performed the law of God our ſelves, in the moſt abſolute perfection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 28. 6</note>

               <p>Seventhly, wee ſpoile Chriſt in our ſelves of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> glory of his name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> in doubting that he not make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us perfectly holy and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely, hath not ſaved us from our ſinnes; of the glory of his Godhead, as not able to effect the ſame; and his Kingly and Propheticall, and Prieſtly offices, of their virtue and power, as not having done the ſame; and ſo aboliſh by our doubting whole Chriſt to our ſelves, and doe fruſtrate and make void his Goſpel and joyfull newes, which hee hath brought from heaven.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, by our unbeliefe and doubting we moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> unthankfully reject from our ſelves, and put away the grace, mercy, and rich bounty of God ſo freely offered unto us, and with the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>deſpiſe the counſell of God againſt our ſelves, Luke</hi> 7. 30. and thus <note place="margin">Luke 7. 30.</note> by this unbeliefe and doubting doe leeſe the free-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>Firſt, for the propertie of Contraries; becauſe as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the nature of all contraries mutually to expell one another, ſo that two flat contraries, cannot poſſibly, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſo gradu,</hi> dwell together at one time in the ſame ſubject, eſpecially in privative contraries: ſo it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally true concerning ſinne, and of making the child of God, perfectly righteous in the ſight of God: As to inſtance in privative contraries. If the Sun break into a dark houſe, and aboliſh all the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:192569:146"/> in that houſe; the houſe is made of neceſſitie all light, and if the houſe be made all light, there is no place for any darkneſſe, but all the darkneſſe is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; ſo likewiſe is it in the caſe of our Juſtification, If God by the power of his imputation, ſo cloath us with his Sonnes righteouſneſſe, that it makes us in his ſight perfectly holy and righteous, then all our ſinnes muſt needs be aboliſhed out of his ſight; if it put away all our iniquitie like a miſt, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, 44. 22. aboliſh all our ſinnes like darkneſſe out of Gods ſight; then it leaves us of neceſſitie, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly righteous in the ſight of God. Which S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly teſtifies, oppoſing theſe two contraries one againſt another, and ſhewing how perfectly they expell one another, and cannot both ſtand together in the ſame ſubject, ſaying thus, <hi>Yee were once darkneſſe;</hi> there is one contrarie, expelled; that is, the ſinfull ſtate of nature aboliſhed, and quite done away from before God, ſignified by the word <hi>once,</hi> or in times paſt; <hi>But now are light in the Lord;</hi> There is the other contrarie remaining and raigning in them, that is, Free Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on making them by an emphaticall figurative ſpeech, put in the Abſtract for the Concrete even light it ſelf; that is, perfectly holy &amp; righteous in the ſight of God; not by their doings and holy walking, but, in the Lord. Thirdly, <hi>walk</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the children of light;</hi> there is ſanctification unſeperably following, and ſhewing, that we that before our Juſtification were darkneſſe, that is, meere lumps of ſin and nothing elſe but ſin inthe ſight of God, are now by Juſtification, changed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of that condition, and are made the clean contrary, even <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> that is, nothing elſe but righteouſneſſe in the ſight of God. Thus (ſaith
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:192569:146"/> 
                  <hi>Luther) They that are called by Chriſt, are tranſlated out of ſinne into righteouſneſſe, out of ſorrow into joy and glad tidings of the Goſpel, out of Gods wrath into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, out of death into liſe:</hi> Becauſe (ſaith he again) <hi>In the place of ſinne, ſucceedeth righteouſneſſe; in the place of wrath, reconciliation; in the place of death, life; and in the place of damnation, ſalvation.</hi> Thus doe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries not dwel together in one and the ſame Subject; but ſinne being aboliſhed by Chriſts righteouſneſſe, this wedding garment makes us and leaves us only and perfectly righteous in the ſight of God; which the Doctrine of our Church, taught by the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of the Goſpel in this Land, doth plainly thus expreſſe, ſaying, <hi>That by virtue of Chriſts blood ſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, we are not only cleane purged from our ſins, but alſo made righteous again in Gods ſight.</hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:192569:151"/> is unquiet; this grace makes a man true and juſt, and this true righteouſneſſe brings peace: thus Chriſt frames all them that belong to him with this ſame one righteouſneſſe of his owne, ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved of others, and makes them juſt, righteous, and ſaved; that as by another mans ſinne we were made ſinners, loſt and damned, ſo by another mans righteouſneſſe we are made righteous and ſaved; and therefore I called this righteouſneſſe an eſſentiall righteouſneſſe, and eternall, and (as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith) everlaſting; becauſe when a man hath it, it alwayes abides and remaines, neither doth ſometimes faile, as the actuall righteouſneſſe doth, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 111.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the firſt, we are to obſerve, that none <note place="margin">1 The Elect cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are made thus righteous.</note> are made thus perfectly holy and righteous, but ſuch of the Elect as are effectually called: becauſe although all the Elect ſhall be juſtified in their time, and none but the Elect ſhall bee juſtified (for whom he juſtifieth, thoſe he glorifieth; but he glorifies none but the Elect;) yet the very Elect, are not actually and really juſtified; but are darkneſſe, and live in ſinne and darkneſſe, untill they be effectually called, as <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teſtifieth ſaying, <hi>Whom he calleth, them he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, Rom. 8. 30.</hi> But who are thus effectually called? <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> Namely, ſuch as doe marke in the death of Chriſt the exceeding horribleneſſe of the leaſt ſinne, there being no ſinne little in the ſight of God; and thereupon come to a feeling of their miſery, and loſt ſtate, by true terror in their ſoules, for the multitude of their ſinnes; thereupon making this concluſion upon themſelves, that if God dealt ſo ſharply with the green tree, Chriſt, for the ſinne which he had not done, but wherein hee was only a ſurety for others, in what a caſe of burning in Gods wrath and juſtice, is hee that is a dry tree, utterly dry of goodneſſe, and hath, as the principall, committed and done, himſelfe, ſo many ſins? and thus is Chriſt made unto him firſt <hi>Wiſdome, 1 Cor. 1. 30.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now ſecondly, for the other point, namely, the <note place="margin">2 How the Elect are juſtified &amp; made perfectly righteous in Gods ſight.</note> manner how the Elect are thus juſtified, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God, is thus:</p>
               <p>The God by the power of his imputation, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sonnes righteouſneſſe to be in us, and upon us, doth in his own ſight ſo cloath us, body and ſoul, both within and without, with the wedding-garment of his ſonnes perfect righteouſneſſe, that we have our ſinnes hereby not only utterly aboliſhed out of Gods ſight; but alſo are Evangelically and freely formed, that is, are in truth and <hi>reipſa,</hi> in very deed made, although not inherently and actively (as I ſaid in the beginning, the Papiſts would have it;) yet objectively and paſſively, perfectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God freely.</p>

               <p>Firſt, take a drinking glaſſe that is blue, or red, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> put water, or drink into the ſame; and in ſome glaſſes I my ſelfe have ſeen, that the drink, or water in the ſame looſeth, to the preſent view, its own colour, and becomes as blue, or red, as the glaſſe it ſelfe; and yet not inherently and actively; for the blueneſſe, or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is inherently, agently, operatively, and actively on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the glaſſe; but yet whilſt it doth abide in the glaſſe, it becomes communicatively and paſſively as blue, or red, as the glaſſe it ſelfe: but what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof? becauſe (as I my ſelfe have obſerved) the glaſſe doth conveigh by the force of the light certain beames of its own colour into the drink, and ſo makes it to loſe its own colour, and to be of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that the glaſſe is of: Where it is pretty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the liquor in the glaſſe, hath loſt its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and hath not loſt it: Firſt, the liquor hath not loſt it inherently and to it ſelfe; becauſe if it be put out of the glaſſe, it is found only in its own colour; But yet hath loſt its own colour in two reſpects: firſt in reſpect of the glaſſe, which it is in, that hath by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing her beams into it; made it own colour: and ſecondly, to the view of the beholder, it is truly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and gone, and nothing remaines but the colour of the glaſſe. Now although the truth repreſented by this ſimilitude, paſſeth the repreſentation as farre as a ſubſtance paſſeth the ſhadow; yet it is ſufficient for a ſhadow, and is a notable repreſentation of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:192569:156"/> the truth; becauſe that Gods powerfull imputation, after a more reall, mighty and effectuall manner, doth the ſame in truth, that is but reſembled in this ſhadow: and faith that went ſo far, as to ſay, <hi>waſh thou me, and I ſhall bee whiter than ſnow,</hi> goes higher than any ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes can reach unto, and ſeeth the ſoule being cloathed with Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to be (although not inherently, yet leſſe imaginarily, and colourably, but truly and <hi>reipſa,</hi> in very deed) made perfectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God; ſo effectually that the very power thereof begins inherently to change the heart by ſanctification alſo, to the eyes of men, more and more; whereas wee ſee that the blueneſſe or redneſſe of the glaſſe, worketh no inherent change upon or in the drink: but becauſe faith reaſoneth and concludes from the power of God thus; That if ſo poore and ſilly a creature as a piece of glaſſe, be able by the force of the light to caſt her beames into it, and to make the liquor to loſe, to the view and ſight of men, her own colour, and to look (whilſt it is in the glaſſe) of the ſame colour, that the glaſſe is of; were it not impiety, and flat blaſphemie not to grant, that Chriſt can much more being true and Almighty God, tranſlating me out of <hi>Adam</hi> to bee a member in himſelfe, by cloathing me, both within and without, with his own righteouſneſſe, conveigh much more, by the power and force of his ſpirit, his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bee thought not inherently and actively, yet objectively and paſſively in us; &amp; ſo by this means abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all our ſinnes from before God, and make us only <hi>perfectly holy &amp; righteous in the ſight of God freely?</hi> herein conſiſting the Analogie of the truth with the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that Chriſt by reaſon of his Godhead, and power

               <p>A ſecond ſimilitude illuſtrating this truth yet <note place="margin">The ſecond ſimilitude.</note> more fully, is this: Let an houſe or ſhop be made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, and let the Sun beat upon the ſame all day long; yet whilſt the windowes and doores are faſt ſhut up, the houſe ſtill remaines dark and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; becauſe the walls being <hi>corpora opaca,</hi> dark bodies, can caſt forth nothing, but darkneſſe; but let the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and doors be opened, then doe the Sun-beames beat in, and diſpell all the darkneſſe that was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the houſe is made all light, and profitable to the uſe of man. But yet it is not inherently and actively light, as the Papiſts conceit of their manner of Juſtification; for if that light did come actively out of the walls, then the houſe would not (at the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately) be beholding to the Sun without it, in the Firmament; but the houſe would be inherently and actively light, immediately enlightning its own ſelfe; but in that it is enlightned by the Sun-beames, the houſe is all light in deed, &amp; yet no Agent, and Doer in making its ſelfe light, but is altogether paſſively and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively light: ſo is it in the caſe of our Juſtification; and being a ſimilitude much uſed by the holy Ghoſt, it paſſeth all other humane ſimilitudes, by running (contrary to the old proverb) <hi>quatuor pedibus:</hi> for</p>

Hence, is that ſaying of <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> before cited, That <hi>as</hi> Adam <hi>unto all that came of him (although they had not eaten of the Tree) became the Author of ſinne and death: So Chriſt unto all that are of him, although they have not yet lived righteouſly, became a maker of them righteous, even with that righteouſneſſe which by his croſſe he freely gives unto us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herewith accordeth the Doctrine of our Church
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:192569:166"/> taught by the firſt Reſtorers of the Goſpel amongſt us, ſaying more plainly thus: That <hi>wee by the virtue of Chriſts blood ſhed upon the Croſſe, are cleane purged from our ſinnes, and made righteous againe in the ſight of God;</hi> What? doe the Doctrine of our Church, and firſt Reſtorers of the Goſpel, ſay, that we are barely counted righteous? no, <hi>but</hi> that we are <hi>made righteous againe;</hi> alluding without doubt by the word <hi>(againe)</hi> unto the ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, that as truly as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> made us ſinners, when before his fall we had no ſinne in ſight of God; So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt hath not come any whit ſhort of his work alſo, and done leſſe upon us; but hath made us though myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, yet truly perfectly holy and righteous again from all ſpot of ſinne in the ſight God freely; this alſo do other faithfull Expoſitors, that were the firſt Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpel, teſtifie plainly unto us, adding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reaſons why it muſt needs bee ſo, that Chriſt by conveying his righteouſneſſe into us, doth indeed and truth make us righteous in the ſight of God, ſaying thus, <hi>For ſeeing before the Tribunall Seat of God it is eſteemed no righteouſneſſe, except it bee the perfect and abſolute obedience of the Law, as Chriſt alone is thus righteous, ſo by conveying his righteouſneſſe into us and upon us, nos juſtos reddit,</hi> that is, he makes us righteous.

               <p>Firſt, becauſe before the Tribunall Seat of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that is, in the truth of his Juſtice, which alwayes reigns, as it were in his breaſt, it is eſteemed of him no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, except it bee the perfect and abſolute

               <p>Secondly, becauſe God doth by the power of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> imputation convey this perfect and abſolute righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt into us; for ſo theſe learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors teſtifie, that the manner of this work is <hi>ſuam justitiam in nos transferendo,</hi> that is, by conveying his righteouſneſſe into us, and upon us; this is that myſticall cloathing before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>nos juſtos reddit,</hi> that is, as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> may be truly underſtood; either God by his powerfull imputation, conveying his righteouſneſſe into us, doth make us righteous; or elſe more immediately, that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſo myſtically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into us, doth make us righteous: whereupon theſe ſaid learned faithfull Expoſitors, doe plainly conclude upon the foreſaid firſt alledged proofe of Scripture, thus: <hi>Quotquot ergò ex Deo nati, &amp;c.</hi> As many therefore as are born of God, and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternall life, <hi>juſti conſtituuntur,</hi> are made righteous, <hi>non modò propter, ſed &amp; per unius obedientiam,</hi> that is, not only for, but alſo, <hi>By the righteouſneſſe of one man Chriſt:</hi> That is, not only for the righteouſneſs inherently and actively in Chriſt, but alſo by that righteouſneſſe objectively and paſſively conveyed into us; and ſo though my<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Firſt, for the ſcope of the place, which is to exhort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſtian Husbands to deale with their Wives as Chriſt hath already dealt with them, as by a pattern perfectly done upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our ſanctification is wrought by us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and by the ſpirit of God enabling us thereunto: but this example is appropriated to Chriſt a lone, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelfe to ſhed his blood to effect it, which properly belongs to the work of our <hi>Free Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſpeakes in the aoriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening, in the participle of the pretertenſe, that he <hi>hath</hi> made us cleane; importing a thing already perfectly done; which is proper only in this life to the work of <hi>Free Iuſtification.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, That he might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> make us to himſelfe a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, he ſaith not to our ſelves, which will be verified indeed by ſanctification in the life to come; for then even to our ſelves, and to our ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wee ſhall not have one ſpot or wrinkle of ſinne or any ſuch thing; but hee ſaith to <hi>make us to himſelfe,</hi> that is, above our ſelves, and above our own reaſon, yea, altogether myſtically, and contrary to our ſelves, and to our own ſenſe and feeling, hath Chriſt already made us fit brides for ſo glorious a bridegroome, which is only in this life by <hi>Free Iuſtification;</hi> neither doth the word <hi>(might make us;)</hi> any whit hinder this ſenſe, <note place="margin">How the ſigne <hi>(might)</hi> may be attributed to a thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt and done.</note> becauſe when this ſign of the potentiall mood, doth follow another action, importing the purpoſe or intent of that precedent action, the ſign <hi>(might)</hi> may ſignifie a thing that is already wrought and perfectly done; as any man may ſay of his brother now living and counted a good Chriſtian, That he was baptized, that he might

               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, for the Participle of the preſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> time immediately following, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith not <hi>non habituram,</hi> that is, the Church is now in ſuch caſe, as that it ſhall not have one ſpot or wrinkle of ſin hereafter; but <hi>non habentem,</hi> not having now at this preſent time, <hi>one ſpot or wrinkle of ſinne or any ſuch thing,</hi> which is only true in this life; not to man-ward by ſanctification, but to God-ward by <hi>Free Iuſtification;</hi> the Greeks and Latines having their proper Tenſes and times, fitly to expreſſe the ſame.</p>

               <p>Now that Gods imputation and ſpirituall cloathing with his Sonnes righteouſneſſe, doth ſo really make us righteous, that after the manner of the forme, <hi>dat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; eſſe;</hi> that is, it gives us both the name and being righteous, although it be cleare and manifeſt by this former point, (becauſe whatſoever is made ſo, or ſo, we ſee by dayly experience, that they bee, and are ſo called accordingly;) yet becauſe it makes to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the former point, as evident effects of the truth of the former; let me briefly touch this alſo. And firſt, that this ſpirituall cloathing with Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe doth ſo really make us righteous, that only that gives us the name of truly juſt, and righteous perſons in the ſight of God, is manifeſt by that often repeated axiome of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Iuſt by faith ſhall live:</hi> For although ſome doe darken the ſenſe, both of the Prophet and of the Apoſtle, by ſaying, <hi>The Iuſt</hi>

               <p>Firſt, that it is faith only embracing, and applying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the righteouſneſſe revealed in the Goſpel, that makes a man <hi>juſt,</hi> and righteous in the ſight of God: And</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this righteouſneſſe not only names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him juſt and righteous, but makes him to live alſo, a Chriſtian godly life in this world; and then to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory in the world to come: ſo that the Apoſtle likens this righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel to the ſoule; as if a Chriſtian had two ſoules in him, firſt as he is a man; and ſecondly, as he is a Chriſtian: his ſoule as he is a man, is his naturall ſoule, by which he lives truly only to this world: but his ſoule as he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <note place="margin">Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is to a Chriſtian, as the ſoule is to the body.</note> is Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that alſo ſanctifies him; and ſo is like the life that the ſoule works in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and makes him live a godly Chriſtian life, in this world; and alſo makes him to live unto eternall glory in the life to come. And as the Phyſitians ſay, that
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:192569:172"/> the vital ſpirits are they that knit and combinde the ſoule and body together; ſo faith is like thoſe vitall ſpirits, that combinde the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt and the Chriſtian together. Whereby as the ſoule gives unto a man, both the name and eſſentiall being of a man, ſo doth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith, give unto a man both the name and eſſentiall being of a Chriſtian; and makes him to live the life of a Chriſtian in this world, and to live unto eternall glory in the life to come: and as by reaſon of the Divine underſtanding ſoule, made to the Image of God, God is ſaid to be neere, and to dwell in us, (whereby as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts, 17. 28.

               <p>Now what can bee required more to make a true Chriſtian?

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:192569:173"/> his ſight, therefore all thoſe large promiſes made in the Pſalms and Old Teſtament, unto the righteous cannot be underſtood (as the Papiſts conceive) of the Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſſe: becauſe <hi>David</hi> that had ſo great a meaſure of inherent righteouſneſſe, cryed out that by this inherent righteouſneſſ <hi>ſhall none be found righteous in Gods ſight;</hi> whereupon thoſe large promiſes made in the Pſalms unto the <hi>Iuſt</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the firſt way, by which they are objectively and paſſively with Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed, though myſtically, yet truly made perfectly righteous, juſt, and Saints in the ſight of God freely: &amp; therefore it is well and truly noted by <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaying, to this effect: <hi>I grant, that the Saints are called righteous, declaratively of their inherent holineſſe of life: yet for as much as by all their endevour, they doe not fulfill righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, it is meet that this inherent righteouſneſſe, ſuch as it is, doe give place to the Being made righteous by faith, from whence it hath that which it is.</hi> But yet <hi>Luthers</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation out of <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrikes this naile more fully to the head, ſaying, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>calleth them only righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which are juſtified through the promiſe, or through faith in the promiſe without the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no marvell that <hi>Paul</hi> calls them that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, only righteous, ſeeing God himſelfe having freely juſtified <hi>Abraham,</hi> made him thereby ſo truly <note place="margin">God calleth <hi>Abraham,</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</note> righteous in his own ſight, that God was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to call him by his juſtification righteous; but even juſtice and righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Eſay</hi>

                  </gap>onounce him to bee righteous; which is in very deed unjuſt, ſeeing the Scripture ſaith that God doth hate the wicked and his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And for as much as God is the higheſt wiſdome, truth, and juſtice; but all men by their own nature are unjuſt and no man can make himſelfe juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but only God, Therefore it followes (ſaith he) that God doth abſolve no man, and pronounce him juſt and righteous, but him <hi>quem prius fecerit juſtum,</hi> that is, whom firſt hee hath made righteous by his grace: then hee ſhewes how God doth make a man righteous by his grace, ſaying thus: But as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is twofold (as we ſhewed before) by which wee are juſtified, that is (ſaith he) by which <hi>fimus juſti,</hi> we are made righteous; ſo God <hi>bifariam facit homines</hi>

               <p>Firſt, when not imputing their ſinnes unto them he forgives all their iniquities, becauſe they are extinct and clean put out by the blood of Chriſt: and on the contrary, by clothing them with his Sons righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, doth make them righteous, as the Apoſtle teſtifies, ſaying, <hi>By the obedience of one man,</hi> (namely imputed) <hi>are many made righteous:</hi> Seeing then this is a true and perfect righteouſneſſe, who (ſaith he) may ſay, that they are not of unjuſt, <hi>verè juſtos eſſe factos,</hi> truly made juſt and righteous, which have in Chriſt gotten and attained this righteouſneſſe?</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſanctifieth them by inherent
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:192569:174"/> righteouſneſſe. Seeing then (ſaith he) God doth with both theſe righteouſneſſe, <hi>nos juſtos reipſa efficere</hi> that is, make us in very deed righteous, with the firſt, righteous before himſelfe, with the other, righteous before men, It can by no meanes be ſaid, when God doth juſtifie his Elect, that hee doth abſolve men, that are ſimply, wicked and unjuſt, and pronounce them juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous (becauſe this were directly repugnant, both to his high juſtice, and truth;) <hi>ſed juſtos à ſe factos abſolvit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God abſolveth only the juſt.</note> that is, firſt he makes them juſt and righteous, and then abſolves them.

               <p>Laſt of all, concerning this point, he ſhewes how a man may know in his owne heart, and how hee himſelf and others may diſcern, that he is juſtified, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before God from all fault and blame, and freed from all ſinne, guilt and puniſhment, and pronounced juſt before God, and an heire of his heavenly kingdome; and ſo (as I ſaid before) is made a true Chriſtian free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Zanch. in loco communi de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtif in Ephe. 2. 5.</note> before God: namely, when he aſſenteth to this maine propoſition of the Goſpel, and aſſumes the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it to himſelfe in his own heart, to wit, That <note place="margin">The maine propoſition of the Goſpel.</note> whoſoever beleeves in the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus, that by his obedience, <hi>tam juſtus factus ſit coram Deo,</hi> he is made as righteous before God, <hi>quam per inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam Adae injuſtus factus fuerat,</hi> as he was by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> made unrighteous, for as much

               <p>By all which it is cleerer than the noone day, That before a man can be free from all guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, and from the power of the ſame, he muſt not only bee barely counted, but muſt firſt be, though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively and paſſively, yet truly and in very deed, <hi>made perfectly holy and righteous, ſpot of ſinne in the ſight of God freely.</hi> And therefore that the true Beleever is not only truly and indeed made righteous; but alſo <hi>perfectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God, freely;</hi> remaines to bee proved by the expreſſe Word of God, and unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the beſt and faithfull Diſpenſors of Gods Goſpel, in the next Chapter.</p>

For the better underſtanding whereof, let us marke the circumſtances of the place, which doe much enlighten the matter. For, comparing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Old Teſtament with that one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, offered up by himſelfe, in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, he ſheweth, That although the blood of Buls and of Goats, being but types, and figures, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the good things to come, are of ſuch force,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:192569:186"/> as ſprinkling the unclean did ſanctifie them to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the fleſh, ſo that the ſacrifice being done and performed, they went away clean from all their ſins; yet notwithſtanding thoſe Sacrifices were ſo weak, that they could not bring perpetuall and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall quietneſſe of conſcience: ſo that when they felt themſelves to ſlip again, and to fall into new ſins and infirmities, they were fain to bring new Sacrifices to renew their peace of conſcience: and why? becauſe it was impoſſible that the blood of Buls, and of Goats, being but ſhadowes of the truth, ſhould take away ſin, and make the commers thereunto perfect; for ſo the figures and ſhadowes ſhould goe away, at leaſt in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, with the glory belonging and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as due unto the ſubſtance it ſelfe. But when Chriſt, the truth it ſelfe, came, ſignified by thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and did fully exhibit himſelfe to performe fully the truth that was repreſented in thoſe figures; Then the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, did ſo fully purge and purifie our conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God, that now there is no need of any more Sacrifice for ſin, becauſe God doth not ſo much as remember our ſins any more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 17. 18. And <note place="margin">Heb 10. 17, 18.</note> why? becauſe <hi>with that one offering</hi> of himſelfe <hi>hee hath made perfect for ever all them that are ſanctified.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Old in foure cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</note> Where let us marke the full perfection of the New Teſtament above the Old, here compared the one with the other, and the New paſſing the Old in foure cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith not inchoatively and imperfectly, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is ſaid of the Old Teſtament, that it made nothing perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. but perfectly.</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:192569:187"/>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith not, that he will make perfect, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but, he hath made perfect; ſignifying, that this perfect making of us righteous in the ſight of God, is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perfectly done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not for a ſeaſon to be by intercourſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> renewed with new Sacrifices (as the Papiſts doe counterfeit in their Maſſe;) but perpetually and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. And,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, not onely for long times, as whole yeers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and ſuch like; but <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> as the doctrine of our Church ſpeaketh. Thus hath Chriſt made all his children and Church righteous, <hi>quarto modo,</hi> that <note place="margin">Chriſt hath made us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>quarto modo.</hi>
                  </note> is, <hi>omnes, ſolos, &amp; ſemper:</hi> firſt, <hi>omnes,</hi> all that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: ſecondly, <hi>ſolos,</hi> only they that are ſanctified: and thirdly, <hi>ſemper,</hi> he hath made them perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, continually, and for ever. Hence he is called <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec,</hi> that is, the King of righteouſneſſe, becauſe he makes all his ſubjects thus righteous: ſecondly, none but his ſubjects only: thirdly, all his ſubjects are made perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God, only and for ever. And therefore did the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 9. 24. propheſie of Chriſt, That at his comming he ſhould not onely make an end of ſin, but alſo <hi>bring in an everlaſting righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, making the children of God perfectly righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee the reaſon why the learned doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the juſtified children of God to be not only fully and completely, but alſo ſufficiently righteous before God. For if the child of God be thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely and perfectly righteous in the ſight of God, then he is ſufficiently righteous in the ſight of God:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:192569:187"/> but if he be not ſufficiently righteous, then is he not perfectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God. But that the juſtified child of God is, above his ſenſe and feeling even ſufficiently, righteous in the ſight of God, is plainly teſtified by God himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, this Moon muſt be under our feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our life is like a continuall walking in this world, as it were in a darke night; and therefore we muſt have the light of our ſanctification, flowing from our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as the light of the <hi>Moon</hi> doth come from the <hi>Sunne,</hi> to direct our feet in this dark world; and to give light, as the <hi>Moon</hi> doth, to other men walking in the dark night of this world, <hi>that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our Father which is in heaven.</hi> And this is the ſecond mark, ſhewing that we are myſtically cloathed with the glorious Sunne of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; becauſe this ſanctification flowes infallibly from our Juſtification, as the light of the Moon comes from the Sun.</p>
               <p>Again, the Moon ſignifies alſo the riches, honours, dignities, profits, and pleaſures of this world; which being changeable and unconſtant as the Moon, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:192569:194"/> children of God have them under their feet, <note place="margin">The juſtified have the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of this life under their feet, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the Moon.</note> as it were; becauſe being cloathed with the glorious Sunne of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and thereby diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worth of the heavenly riches, they ſet light of theſe earthly glories, ſhining to the dark world like the Moon; and doe tread them under feet, uſing them as if they uſed them not, being ready to leave all, for the further advantage and advancing of the heavenly riches, and for the glory of God. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> being come to yeeres of diſcretion, <hi>refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s daughter; and choſe rather to ſuffer adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon: Eſteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> Why? Becauſe <hi>he had regard to the recompence of the great reward of the unſearchable riches</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls them) <hi>of the Goſpel.</hi> So the Chriſtians in the Primitive Church <hi>ſuffered with joy the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing in themſelves</hi> (by being cloathed with the glorious Sunne, and wedding-garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe) <hi>that they had in heaven a better and more enduring ſubſtance.</hi> And this is the very Head of our ſanctification, and the third mark, ſhewing, that we are <hi>the woman in heaven cloathed with the Sun.</hi>

And in this ſenſe did S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, and the true right
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:192569:204"/> faith muſt ever ſay, <hi>I live not now, but Chriſt lives in mee: and in that I now live, I live by the faith in the Sonne of God, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for mee;</hi> namely, to Juſtifie me, and thereby hath made mee by himſelfe alone, <hi>perfectly and gloriouſly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſinne, in the ſight of God freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doth God behold us, being Juſtified in the imperfections of our ſanctification: why? becauſe as I have abundantly ſhewed before, both by expreſſe Scripture, as alſo by the unanimous conſent of all the beſt Diſpenſers of Gods myſteries, That Juſtification doth not only preſent us, and our perſons, perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God <hi>freely;</hi> but alſo taketh away from before God, and aboliſheth all the imperfections of all our works out of the ſight of God: ſo that <hi>to the pure</hi> and to the believing <hi>all things are pure;</hi> as to the unbelieving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is pure; but their beſt good works are filthy and abhominable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Now then when both the perſons of the believing are by Chriſts righteouſneſſe perfectly pure in the ſight of God; and when all the imperfections of their works are aboliſhed out of Gods ſight, thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them alſo perfectly pure and righteous in the ſight of God, how then doth God ſee them in the imperfections of their ſanctification? but to ſay, when God hath juſtified both us and our works, that God ſees us in the imperfections of our ſanctification, is another evident mark of an hypocrite, that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">An evident mark of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</note> yet truly humbled for the imperfections of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; nor ever yet truly killed with the Apoſtle, by underſtanding the tenth Commandement, making both him and all his righteouſneſſe, and beſt good

               <p>The firſt is expreſſed by <hi>Luther,</hi> ſaying after this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> manner: <hi>We muſt not weigh ſo much how great the thing is, that is given, and how unworthy we are of it (for ſo ſhould the greatneſſe of the gift, and our unworthineſſe terrifie us;) but we muſt principally conſider, firſt the greatneſſe of the giver; and ſecondly, that it pleaſeth God freely to give us this unſpeakable gift; unto us (I ſay) which are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</hi> Now if it be the pleaſure of a great noble man to give to a poore man a great gift, he doth not refuſe it, how great ſoever the gift bee; becauſe it is the great mans pleaſure that he ſhould have it: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke 12. 32.

                  <hi>is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you a Kingdome:</hi> mark how he ſaith firſt, <hi>it is his pleaſure;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>to give unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Kingdome: to whom? to you unworthy, which are his little flock. If I then be little, and the thing great (nay rather, of all things the greateſt) which God hath given unto me, I muſt think, that he alſo is great and only great, which giveth it. If he offer it, and will give it; I conſider not mine owne ſinne, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but his fatherly good will towards me, which is the giver; and I receive the greatneſſe of the gift with joy and gladneſſe, and am thankfull for ſo ineſtimable a gift given freely unto me, to me (I ſay) unworthy, by the hearing of faith.</hi> A little glimmering of this boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous nature of God, and our duty in taking his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given benefits, we have in King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:192569:215"/> who, when a ſervant and ſouldier of his that had ſerved him in conquering the world, whereof he was now Monarch, being a poore man, came to King <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and beſought him, that he would beſtow the value of twenty pounds upon his daughter that was now to be married; the King preſently commanded the value of a thouſand pounds to be given him: and when the poore man acknowledged that it was too great a gift for him ſo poore a man to receive, the King anſwered, That although he thought it too great a benefit for him to receive, yet it was not too great for him to give; and therefore hee ſhould take it, and have it. Which the poore man ſeeing to be his pleaſure that he ſhould have, took the bounty of the King, was glad thereof, and went his way thankfull for the ſame. Now is this King <hi>Alexander</hi> nothing, and as it were, but an Ape in imitating that bounteous nature of God; who giving righ gifts and benefits unto us, agreeable to his exceeding greatneſſe, to make us rich and bleſſed, ſhall not we freely take that which of his exceeding boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous nature he freely offers? but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ooking upon our owne unworthineſſe, ſhall we reſiſt his pleaſure, and refuſe his rich bounty? Very effectually therefore is this point preſſed by the doctrine of our Church in this caſe of free Juſtification; where, in the Sermon of <note place="margin">Doctrine of our Church in the ſermon of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Reſurrection of Chriſt having taught, <hi>That it is not enough to have, by the death of Chriſt, our ſinnes done away; but alſo by his Reſurrection we are endowed with a perfect and everlaſting righteouſneſſe,</hi> freely repleniſhing us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with all righteouſneſſe; preſently to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith, it addeth this ſalve againſt doubting, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Doubt not of the truth of this matter, how great and high ſoever theſe things be: it becommeth God to doe</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Remedy againſt the feare of applying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo great wealth and felicity wrought upon us by Chriſt, effectuall to ſtrengthen our faith, is to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the ſixth thing propoſed to be ſpoken of, in the beginning of this ſecond part of Juſtification; namely, <hi>the End,</hi> why God freely beſtowes upon us ſo great wealth and felicity, not ayming chiefly at our glory herein, but to declare and manifeſt his owne glory, by magnifying upon us his free grace, and rich bounty: and therefore we muſt freely take by faith, which is the hand of the ſoule, this rich bounty of God; that ſo this glory of his free grace may be magnified upon us, and that we may be paſſive inſtruments of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious doings, and rich bounty wrought upon us by himſelfe only and alone. For doth hee not greatly manifeſt his owne perfect juſtice and righteouſneſſe, in that none can pleaſe him, but ſuch only as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous in his ſight? and that none can be ſuch, except he himſelfe, above their ſenſe and feeling, take in hand to make them ſuch in his owne ſight freely, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace?</hi> Yes verily, and therefore is it ſo flatly teſtified by the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>Rom. 3. 24. 25, 26. wee are juſtified</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>freely by his grace in his Sonnes blood:</hi> why? or to what
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:192569:216"/> end? <hi>to ſhew</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at this time his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, and the Iuſtifier of him,</hi> or the maker of him juſt, <hi>that is of the faith of Ieſus:</hi> Which glory of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be proper to God only, is notably expreſſed by <note place="margin">Eſay 44. 22, 23.</note> the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 22, 23. ſaying, <hi>I will put away thy tranſgreſsion as darkneſſe, and aboliſh thy ſins as a miſt; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce yee heavens, for the Lord hath done it; ſhout yee lower parts of the earth, hurſt forth into praiſe O Mountaines, &amp;c. For thus hath God redeemed his people, and thus will he be glorified in Iſrael.</hi> Becauſe when we take this benefit by faith, and rejoyce with this joy for the ſame, we give him truly, the glory of his grace, and rich bounty.</p>
               <p>And therefore we muſt mark that, which few mark; <note place="margin">Two wayes of glorifying God.</note> namely, that there are two wayes of glorifying God, one primary and immediate to Gods own eyes; and another that is ſecondary, and mediate, that is, to the eyes of men: the firſt &amp; immediate way of glorifying God, to his own eyes, is to take by faith, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him on his word, that thoſe rich benefits freely promiſed, are wrought upon us, which to reaſon are impoſſible, &amp; for greatneſſe incredible; and yet embrace the ſame with joy. And this kinde of glorifying of God, is ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. where it is ſaid, that, <hi>Abraham doubted not of the promiſe of God by unbeliefe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>but was ſtrengthned in faith, and gave glory to God.</hi> The other kinde of glorifying God, which is ſecondary to the eyes of men, is by works teſtifying our faith to the eyes of men; and is ſpoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. ſaying, <hi>Let your light</hi> (to wit of faith) <hi>ſo ſhine before men, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>they may ſee your good works</hi> of Sanctification, <hi>and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your father which is in heaven.</hi> But look how farre the Sun paſſeth the Moon, or rather a candle for brightneſſe; ſo farre doth our glorifying of God
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:192569:216"/> directly to his own eyes, the firſt way, by joyfull em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the greatneſſe of his benefits, paſſe the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him; by works to the eyes of men, the ſecond way: Becauſe the firſt is meerly paſſive in us, ſuffering God to glorifie himſelfe upon us, by working his ineſtimable benefits freely upon us: The ſecond is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative and active in us, by which wee declare the free goodneſſe of God, freely beſtowed upon us. The firſt is inward, ſpirituall, and divine, wholly tending to the prayſe of God, firſt creating (as it were) the glory of God in us. For whereas it is the nature of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe (as <hi>Brentius</hi> well deſcribes) <hi>to be very curious, and inquiſitive,</hi> and at the ſmalleſt appearance contrary to the promiſe, doubts of God ſpeaking it, <hi>one while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king queſtion whether the Word be the Word; another while making queſtion of the meaning of the Word; another while</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>looking to the fewneſſe and ſimpleneſſe of them that hold the Word; another while looking at the multitude and greatneſſe of them that hold otherwiſe; but ever ſeeking ſome witty eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby it may ſeem to do honeſtly in not believing the Word of God, as it plainly ſpeaks:</hi> And ſorobs God of the glory of his truth and of his power; and with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wit makes him a liar: So on the contrary ſide, faith reſting upon the naked and plain word ſpoken, becauſe it ſeemes contrary to reaſon, and outward ſenſe and feeling, it flies to the truth, and power of the Promiſer, making him true in his ſpeaking, and able to perform it; and ſo gives him the glory of his Living, and Being, and true working in us: whereby (as <hi>Luther</hi> truly ſpeaks) <hi>faith is (as a man would ſay) the Creator of a certaine Divinity, not in the ſubſtance of God, but in us; and ſo by putting us in poſſeſsion of Gods bounteous divine benefits, doth truly make us divine people:</hi> And for this
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:192569:217"/> firſt kinde of glorifying God, is <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo often called in the Word, <hi>the friend of God.</hi> But the ſecond kind of glorifying God is outward, more fleſhly, and humane, not creating and making, but ſhewing after a groſſer manner to the eyes of worldly men, that we are made divine perſons: whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>By the exceeding great and precious promiſes you are partakers of the Divine nature:</hi> But how manifeſted and declared? <hi>In that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yee flie the corruption that is in the world through luſt, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. And this ſecond active kinde of glorifying God, becauſe we are Agents in it, and doe it by the ſpirit, greatly inclines to the glorifying of man; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied works and holy life of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father hath found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fleſh? For if</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified</hi> (that is, made righteous in the ſight God, <hi>by</hi> the holy <hi>works</hi> of his ſanctification) <hi>he had wherein to rejoyce or glory (viz.</hi> before men) <hi>but not before God? But what ſaith the Scripture?</hi> Abraham <hi>believed that God himſelfe took in hand to make him righteous, by clothing him with his Sons righteouſneſſe, whereby he was made ſpiritually, divinely, heavenly and perfectly righteous:</hi> not for mans account, which counteth of righteouſneſſe by halfes; but in Gods account, whoſe count is perfect; and counts it not righteouſneſſe, except he himſelfe, alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doe make his creature perfectly and gloriouſly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin, in his own ſight freely: This <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, enjoyed the benefit thereof, and gave glory to God; and therefore was called the friend of God, becauſe he glorified him in this principall glory, wherein hee will be glorified in the greatneſſe of his benefits freely beſtowed; which
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:192569:217"/> eſpecially in his Goſpel, are correſpondent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his great and glorious nature; and therefore, being above humane capacitie, and to reaſon impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is principally glorified by taking them by faith; and this faith, ſeeing and diſcerning the greatneſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, makes the true Believer <hi>to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But alas, here wee may take up <hi>Luthers</hi> complaint, <hi>That this knowledge and benefit of Chriſt to come, the Saints of the Old Teſtament rejoyced more in, and ſo glorified God more for the ſame, than wee now doe, when hee is ſo brightly and comfortably revealed and exhibited unto us: Indeed,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>we do confeſſe that this knowledge of Chriſt, and of the righteouſneſſe of faith, is an ineſtimable treaſure; but wee conceive not thereby ſuch a full joy of ſpirit, as the Prophets and Apoſtle did.</hi> But what is the reaſon hereof? Becauſe (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> in another place,) <hi>They did not conſider ſo coldly the promiſes made unto the Fathers, as wee doe; but did reade them, and weigh them with great diligence:</hi> But they that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not this benefit of fee Juſtification (whereof the Goſpel ſpecially intreateth) and ſo doe prize no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſſe, beſides the righteouſneſſe of works, works, when they heare this righteouſneſſe of faith preſſed, and the excellencie thereof advanced, they are offended; objecting that it is ſo farre from glorifying God two wayes, that it makes men ſecure and careleſſe to all good works. But what (ſaith the Doctrine of our Church) is the cauſe hereof? Even this (as <hi>Luther</hi> alſo teſtifieth) <hi>Becauſe, they underſtand nothing of Free Iuſtification, or elſe they underſtand it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: for their minds are occupied with other cogitations, and fantaſticall imaginations of their own works; therefore</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:192569:218"/> 
                  <hi>things ſeeme unto them ſtrange matters,</hi> and no meanes to glorifie God, neither paſſively by faith, nor active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by works; but the children of wiſdome will imitate the Prophets and Apoſtles, who becauſe they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the great glory thereof, and felt true joy of ſpirit for the ſame, therefore (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> did they (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Paul)</hi> ſo plentifully ſet forth, and ſo diligently teach the Article of Juſtification: For (ſaith he) <hi>this is the proper office of an Apoſtle,</hi> or as one may ſay, the eſſence of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>to preach among people the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 8.</note> the cauſe and fountaine of all the reſt, namely, Free Juſtification; wherewith (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

               <p>The firſt excellent fruit and effect hereof is this, <note place="margin">1 Firſt Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That the right knowledge of free Juſtification doth truly enlighten us, and brings us into a wonderfull light.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:192569:221"/> 
                  <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things;</hi> then they ſeeing that nothing could make them ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin, in the ſight of God, but the crucifying of the Sonne of God, they begin truly to crucifie that, which they now ſee to be the Crucifier of the Lord of glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it brings us to ſee not only the foulneſſe <note place="margin">2 The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Juſtice.</note> of ſin, but alſo the perfection of Gods juſtice againſt ſinne, and his implacable diſpleaſure and anger againſt the ſame; in that he cannot be reconciled from this diſpleaſure, or anger, except he ſee his creature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſin, in his ſight. Which although the foreſaid definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law ſeemes to doe, yet becauſe it ſmites terrour and deſpaire into them, it makes men to ſtrive to forget it, and to fly from God, and to runne into more ſin, untill they ſee Gods love in making them <hi>perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſinne, in his owne ſight freely:</hi> and then they come to acknowledge cheerfully the perfection of his juſtice, and the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his diſpleaſure and anger againſt the leaſt ſin; becauſe they ſee by the death of his Son, to make them cleane from all ſin, that there is no ſin little in the ſight of God. Now they come to ſee the truth of that ſaying of <hi>David: Thou art not a God that loveth wickedneſſe, neither ſhall any evill dwell with thee, Pſal.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">Pſal. 5. 4.</note> 4. Now they come to ſee the truth of that ſaying of <hi>Habak. Thou art of pure eyes, and canſt not ſee evill, thou canſt not behold wickedneſſe,</hi> but thou muſt needs deſtroy the ſinner, or ſin from him that ſees, by it, his miſery, by making him <hi>perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſinne, in thy ſight freely.</hi> And that free Juſtification thus declares and manifeſteth the juſtice of God, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:192569:221"/> brings people thus profitably to ſee the perfection of it, and glorifie it, is teſtified plainly by S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 26. ſaying, <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God by the faith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>of Ieſus Chriſt, is unto all, and upon all that doe beleeve,</hi> freely juſtifying them, that is, making them perfectly holy and righteous in the ſight of God freely: but to what end? <hi>To declare</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>his righteouſneſſe</hi> (namely, that it alone pleaſes him) <hi>that hee might thus ſee himſelfe to bee juſt, and the juſtifier of him, that is, of the faith of Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the right knowledge of free Juſtification <note place="margin">3 The meaning of the tenth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> brings a man to ſee and underſtand the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and thereby the ſpirituall meaning of all the ten Commandements, which men, though wiſe, and learned, and very religious, both in their owne opinion, and judgement of others, doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: as is to be ſeene in the Scribes and Phariſees, whom Chriſt was faine in the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh Chapters of <hi>Matth.</hi> in the ſpirituall meaning of the Law, to chatechiſe like young children in all the ten Commandements. But when a man underſtands <hi>free Iuſtification</hi> rightly, then he underſtands the tenth Commandement, and ſees how horrible groſſe ſins, in the ſight of God, the leaſt breaches thereof are (which the blinde world counts nothing, and ſees all his beſt works and holy walking to be) by reaſon of that tenth Commandement, but as a menſtruous cloath; and ſo kills him, in making him to ſee, that he is a damnable <note place="margin">1 By the help and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God.</note> loſt ſinner in the ſpirituall breach of all the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. A notable example hereof is S. <hi>Paul</hi> who whilſt he was a Phariſee, he walked diligently and <note place="margin">2 God being mercifull to pardon ſmall matters.</note> zealouſly; ſo holily and righteouſly in all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that in his owne opinion, and in the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:192569:222"/> judgement of others, concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Law, he was unrebukable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7. But when <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7.</note> he was once juſtified, and underſtood rightly the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſame; then he underſtood the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; and then he cried out, that <hi>the Law was ſpirituall, but</hi> (although his life was then moſt of all ſanctified) <hi>yet he felt himſelfe carnall, and ſold under ſinne: then he felt that in him, that is, in his fleſh, dwelt no good thing;</hi> and cried out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Thus did the tenth Commandement kill him, being by the right underſtanding of <hi>free Iuſtification,</hi> effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened in the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, this right knowledge of free <note place="margin">4 It opens the cloſets of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> Juſtification opens unto us the very cloſets of heaven; whereby, as it were with <hi>Stephen,</hi> the heavens being opened, it ſhewes us all the admirable glory of Chriſt, and all the riches of heaven: ſo that never did <hi>Moſes,</hi> being upon the top of Mount <hi>Piſhgah,</hi> more brightly ſee all the beauty and glory of the land of Promiſe, than we being juſtified by faith, doe ſee all the riches, treaſures, and glory of the Kingdome of Chriſt; whereby with S. <hi>Paul, wee deſire to know nothing elſe, ſave Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified;</hi> to purchaſe unto us ſuch unſearchable riches, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 8.</hi> Yea we begin <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 8.</note> truly to count all things loſſe, for the excellent knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; and to judge them to be dung, that we may winne Chriſt, and be found in him; not having our owne righteouſneſſe, of holy walking according to the Law, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of God through faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9.</hi> whereby <hi>we behold,</hi> in this Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <note place="margin">Phil. 3 8, 9.</note> as it were in a looking-glaſſe, <hi>the glory of</hi>

                     <hi>Calvin</hi> on Gal. 2. 16.</note> moſt truly ſaith thus: <hi>That without the knowledge of this benefit of Iuſtification, we know neither our owne fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, nor Gods righteouſneſſe:</hi> but if we doe rightly know it, with a joyfull underſtanding of it; as it alone makes us (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>a choſen generation, a royall Prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people unto God;</hi> ſo it makes us <hi>to ſhew forth the virtues and praiſes of him who hath called us out of darkneſſe into his marvelous, or wonderfull light, 1 Pet. 2. 9.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond maine point ſhewing the majeſty and <note place="margin">2 The ſecond maine point ſhewing the majeſty of free Iuſtification.</note> utility of the right knowledge of free Juſtification is, That it not only delivers us from the fivefold puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to the leaſt ſin, ſpoken of before in the ſecond chapter: which God by his righteous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and revealed law, daily executeth upon one or other, in one place or other: but alſo it is the only cauſe that brings upon us, and puts us in poſſeſſion of all the contrary, great, and glorious benefits of the Goſpel: ſix of the principall and chiefeſt whereof; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though notongue of man or Angels is able to lay forth <note place="margin">The deep ſea of God, mercy</note> the unſearchable riches and glory of them; yet I will briefly touch them, leaving them to the large plummet of thy meditations, to ſound the bottome of this deep ſea; which the deeper thou ſoundeſt, the more thou ſhalt finde thy ſelfe ſwallowed up with the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of theſe benefits: which I will briefly handle in order, as in an experimentall feeling, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

For he that made thee, is thine husband (whoſe name is the Lord of hoſtes) and thy Redeemer, who ſhall be called the God of the whole world.

Which voice of God from heaven, <hi>Luther</hi> expounding, ſaith moſt effectually after this manner: <hi>This ſermon was not like the ſermon which he made when he gave the ten Commandements; neither doth hee now appeare in that forme and manner, wherein he appeared, cum Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum illud vetus conderet, when he framed the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made his Covenant with the people of Iſrael, by his law given by</hi> Moſes <hi>upon Mount Sinai; when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were be-clouded, and darkned with thick black clouds: when nothing was heard but thunderings and lightnings, ſo terribly and horribly ſounding, that the Mountaine</hi>

Not after this manner (I ſay) doth God ſhew himſelfe here, but after a farre other and contrary forme and manner; for here appeares nothing but light, cleereneſſe, and brightneſſe; here all things are pleaſant and joyfull: Hic nutus, vultus, aſpectus Dei amaeniſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; blandiſsimus;</hi> that is, here the beck, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and look of God is moſt pleaſant, and ſmiling; here the heavens are opened; here all creatures ſeeme <note place="margin">Heaven open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all creatures leap for joy.</note> to laugh, and to ſpring and leap for joy; in that the majeſty of God doth ſo humble it ſelfe, as to deſcend, and come downe to us, that there may appeare no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement between God and man: and to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee beholden of us in a forme and manner, <hi>longè amabiliſsima, blandiſsima, &amp; gratiſsima,</hi> moſt lovely, moſt gentle, and moſt favourable: By which manner of appearing, he not only teſtifieth, <hi>omnem ſuam iram ſopitam &amp; ſedatam eſſe,</hi> that is, all his anger and diſpleaſure to be pacified, and aſſwaged; but alſo <hi>in ejus locum infinita &amp; immenſa gratia, &amp;c.</hi> in the place thereof is ſucceeded infinite and unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable free favour, a well-pleaſed father-like, and ardent affection of love towards us; <hi>&amp; inexhauſta copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſaque miſericordia,</hi> and an abundant and bottomleſſe mercy and peace is upon us.

               <p>But the reaſon why all anger and diſpleaſure of God <note place="margin">Juſtification is the only ground and cauſe of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</note> is ſo utterly aboliſhed from us; and why we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored into ſuch perfect peace, and full favour with God againe, ariſeth and is wrought (as I ſaid) only by the two parts of free Juſtification: For firſt,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:192569:224"/> ſeeing all anger and diſpleaſure of God ariſeth only for ſinne: as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortned, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

                  <hi>ſave, neither is his eare heavie, that it cannot heare: But your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you.</hi> When Chriſt himſelfe hath ſeparated our ſinnes from us, and from all our works, as is before ſhewed, as farre as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, by utter aboliſhing them out of his Fathers ſight; Where are they then to ſeparate between God and us? And when Chriſt hath by his blood, made us and all our works clean from all ſinne, ſo that wee and all that wee doe, are from all ſpot of ſinne, in the ſight of God, whither than ſnow; where is there any place then for the diſpleaſure and anger of God to come upon us? Whereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> thus, <hi>And you that were in times paſt</hi> (mark in times paſt) <hi>Strangers and enimies</hi> to God: (And why enimies? <hi>Becauſe your minds were ſet on evill works;</hi> being moſt true that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nec inimici eramus Deo, niſi quemadmodum juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae inimica ſunt peccata;</hi> that is, neither were we eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, otherwiſe than as ſins are enimies to righteouſneſſe,) <hi>hath he now reconciled:</hi> that is, ſeeing all theſe make-bates are aboliſhed, now all diſpleaſure, all anger, and emnity is utterly aboliſhed from between God and you, and you are ſet in the compleat love, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, and full favour of God again, and are bleſſed before God: Oh happy ſtate and condition! But who wrought this? and by what meanes, is ſo glorious a work brought to paſſe? The Apoſte anſwereth: becauſe <hi>Chriſt in the body of his fleſh, through death, makes you ſo holy, that you are unblameable, and without fault in Gods</hi>

And becauſe none can take away ſinne from before God, but Chriſt only, therefore, none can be our peace-maker, but Chriſt only: but becauſe hee takes it away perfectly from before his Father, Therefore is hee a moſt perfect Peace-maker, between God and us. Whereby wee may ſee the truth, of that joyfull ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> upon thoſe words pronounced by God from heaven: <hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> ſaying, after this manner, <hi>Truly with no praiſes could Chriſt bee more glorified, nor extolled more magnificently; for by this voyce hee is ſet in a moſt illuſtrious dignity, and high glory: for in theſe words, Hee is proclaimed and declared the true King of peace, a true Prieſt, working perfect atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt is the true King of peace.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Heire and Lord of all things, who alone pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth his Father, and brings to paſſe, that hee is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with us. Moreover in theſe words God the Father teſtifieth that hee is of a right fatherly and well-pleaſed minde to them that believe in Chriſt; to theſe he declares, and here opens himſelfe wholy; and leaves it witneſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our conſciences, that he is not (as before) offended with us, for our ſins: but now is become a moſt loving,</hi> and <hi>(eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſi per imprudentiam &amp; infirmitatem carnis ceſpitavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that is, although we trip unawares, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of the fleſh; yet,) a moſt indulgent and ſo well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed a Father unto us; <hi>ut nec velit, nec poſsit nobi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, ſecondly, As by the firſt part of Juſtification <note place="margin">Second Reaſon.</note> aboliſhing all our ſinnes out of Gods ſight, all diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and anger is aboliſhed, and done away; ſo by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of Juſtification, making us perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of God. are we perfectly reconciled to God, and ſet in perfect peace, and perfect favour with God again, and truly bleſſed. And this is plainly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. 14. ſaying, <hi>Who amongſt us</hi>

This alſo is expreſſed by Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. 21. ſaying, <hi>God was in Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>and reconciled the world to himſelfe;</hi> not only by not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their ſinnes unto them; but alſo becauſe <hi>Hee that knew no ſinne, was made ſinne for us, that wee</hi> being <hi>tranſlated into him, might bee made the Righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> That is, we being, by this power of Gods impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Sons righteouſneſſe unto us, made in the ſight of God, nothing elſe (as it were) but a perfect, pure, and everlaſting Righteouſneſſe of God, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſet in a perfect favour, perfect reconcilement and love, and in a full pleaſing everlaſting peace with God.

               <p>The Reaſons are, firſt becauſe otherwiſe the holy <note place="margin">1 Firſt Reaſon.</note> Ghoſt ſhould come to dwell in a foule hog-ſtie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſin; which becauſe hee utterly abhorres, therefore firſt he makes cleane the houſe, and prepares us for himſelfe by Juſtification; thus purifying our hearts firſt to himſelfe, by applying unto it Chriſts righteouſneſſe, ſo preparing and making us fit houſes and Temples for himſelfe to dwell in; and then comes and dwells in us, renewing our nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to our ſelves, and to our ſenſe and feeling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by ſanctification: another Reaſon is, becauſe it is the proper office of the holy Ghoſt to glorifie Chriſt: but how doth he glorifie Chriſt? <hi>By taking his things and ſhewing them unto us, Iohn</hi> 16. 14. whereby the <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 14.</note> holy Ghoſt by the preaching of the Goſpel, ſhewing to his elect the excellency of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and enabling them to receive the ſame by faith, and ſo to be ſpiritually and myſtically clothed with it to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Chriſt in this his righteouſneſſe, He enters in it, and by it, into all the faithfull, to dwell in them, thus
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:192569:231"/> glorifying the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it comes to paſſe, that look how freely the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt is, by the preaching of the Goſpel, beſtowed upon them that feele their miſery by ſin, to juſtifie and heale them freely: ſo freely alſo is the holy Ghoſt beſtowed upon them to dwell in them; and therefore in the very preaching of <hi>free Iuſtification,</hi> whilſt the Preacher is yet ſpeaking, doth God uſe principally and eſpecially to raine downe the holy Ghoſt upon the Hearers, even whilſt they do nothing but ſit ſtill, and reverently heare Juſtification freely preached unto them. Whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> convinced the Galathians by ſaying, <hi>Received yee the holy Ghoſt by the law?</hi> that is, by hearing works, works preached? No: how then? <hi>By hearing of faith,</hi> that is, free Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication preached, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. An evident example <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2.</note> hereof is extant, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. where we may ſee, that <note place="margin">Acts 10. 44.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> was preaching Chriſt, and <hi>free juſtification</hi> by him, <hi>even whilſt he was yet ſpeaking, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> Another notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, beſides many others in that book, is <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> where likewiſe we may ſee, that when <hi>Paul</hi> had very powerfully preached the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and eagerly preſſing the maine fruit and benefit that comes thereof, namely, <hi>free juſtification,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Be it knowne unto you men and brethren, that by this man, is preached unto you, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes;</hi> and leſt we ſhould conceive Gods forgiveneſſe to be a ſlight thing, not <note place="margin">Gods forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a moſt excellent and glorious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe.</note> making the creature <hi>perfectly holy and righteous,</hi> like mans forgiveneſſe, He preſently expounds what hee meanes by Gods forgiveneſſe, and ſhewes what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing Gods forgiveneſſe is above mans; ſaying, <hi>Even from all things, from which you could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:192569:232"/> that is, made perfectly righteous <hi>by the law of God, by him every one that beleeveth is juſtified;</hi> that is, made perfectly holy and righteous, from all ſpot of ſinne, in the ſight of God freely. And when there were ſome Jewes among them that marvelled, and wondered, and murmured againſt it, that they that had not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for it, ſhould freely have the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe equall with them that had laboured all day long, in the heat of the day, to get it: to whom <hi>Paul</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, ſaying, <hi>Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away: for I will work a work in your dayes, which yee will not beleeve, though a man ſhould declare or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it unto you:</hi> And yet ſome others, both Jewes and Gentiles <hi>beſought Paul, that he would preach the ſame words to them the next Sabbath day:</hi> which alſo he did: but what was the end and effect of this vehement prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>free Iuſtification?</hi> namely this; <hi>That the Diſciples hearts were filled with joy, and with the holy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> verſ. 51. And if any man here object, That theſe are extraordinary examples belonging only to the Primitive Church. I grant that it is true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the outward viſible raining downe of the holy Ghoſt, for the firſt miraculous ſtabliſhing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by viſible appearances of the ſame: but not for the inward ſpirituall working of Juſtification, and raining downe of the holy Ghoſt upon Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſpiritually and inviſibly to dwell in them: for this is eſſentiall and perpetuall to the Goſpel; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. proving thereby <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. The glory of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Law.</note> the glory of the Goſpel, above the Law, ſaying, That <hi>although the miniſtration of death and condemnation,</hi> that is, the giving of the Law, was glorious, <hi>ſo that the children of Iſrael could not behold the face of Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:192569:232"/> 
                  <hi>for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away; how ſhall not the Goſpel be much more glorious?</hi> why? becauſe the Law did exact at our hands, that we ſhould give to God a perfect righteouſneſſe: but the Goſpel gives unto us a perfect righteouſneſſe freely, and thereby is the perpetuall adminiſtration of the Spirit unto us; whereby (ſaith he) this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of righteouſneſſe <hi>doth exceed in glory.</hi> So that we ſee, that the preaching of free Juſtification is the adminiſtration or miniſteriall giving, both of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt unſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</note> righteouſneſſe, and alſo of the holy Ghoſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably ever going with the ſame; for the holy Ghoſt will not forſake the wedding-garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; but to glorifie the ſame, will goe in it, and with it, whitherſoever it goes; filling the heart, where they two abide, with joy, and right zealous new obedience.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon, why the holy Ghoſt goes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably ever with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, is, Becauſe the preaching of <hi>free Iuſtification</hi> is after a more peculiar manner, called the voice of Chriſt; becauſe it is the only and ſole ſaving voice of Chriſt <note place="margin">Iuſtification is Chriſts voice.</note> alone: but the voice of Chriſt being rightly and powerfully uttered, is not a dead weak thing, but is mighty, and goes with a lively breath, breathing out no leſſe than the holy Ghoſt upon the attentive and reverent Hearers of <hi>free Iustification,</hi> the only ſoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving, and ſole-ſaving voice of Chriſt, making them to live a new life: according to that ſaying of Chriſt: <hi>verily, verily I ſay unto you, the houre ſhall come, and now is, that the dead ſhall heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it,</hi> namely, as the voice of the Sonne of God, <hi>ſhall live, Iohn</hi> 5. 25. ſurely, they <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 25.</note>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:192569:233"/> muſt needs live when the voyce of Chriſt thus breathes the holy Ghoſt into them, to dwell in them. But now concerning the excellency of this wonderfull gift brought upon us only by <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> who is <note place="margin">The glory of this gift is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable.</note> able either of men or Angels to lay forth the glory of it? For is not <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> true, and very God, that takes up our bodies &amp; ſouls, to be his bleſſed Temples? Was it not this bleſſed Spirit, that wonderfully go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Patriarks? Was it not he that inſpired all the Prophets? as <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth ſaith, <hi>Theſe holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpak as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt? 2 Pet. 1. 21.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> Was not his power wonderfully ſhewed, and was hee not a mighty worker, when he formed the humane nature of our Saviour Chriſt, to bee conceived and born of a pure Virgin? Shewing that where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt worketh, there nothing is impoſſible? Is it not hee only that regenerateth a man, and makes him a new born creature, both towards God by <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> and towards man by <hi>Sanctification?</hi> Or can any man worthily lay forth the glory of a new creature, by the holy Ghoſt?

But to ſhew yet further, how true, reall, and ſubſtantiall this Union is, cleere is the teſtimony of <hi>Paul, Epheſ. 5. 31.</hi> ſaying, <hi>For we are members of his body, of his fleſh,</hi>

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:192569:234"/> more and more into one body with Chriſt. But that we may dive more deeply into this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glory of our Union into Chriſt, Let us mark that the holy Ghoſt, (which effectually ſheweth the power of his God-head, in working this benefit upon us) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſubſtantiallneſſe, and reallneſſe, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloſneſſe of it, doth uſe ſix principall ſimilitudes in <note place="margin">Six ſimilitudes uſed to expreſs the realneſſe of this union.</note> the Word of God, to ſhew to our weak capacities the great glory of it, <hi>That</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>paſſeth knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, and furthereſt off ſimilitude, is, That the juſtified perſon, being cloathed with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; hath thereby put on Chriſt as a man puts on, and is cloathed with his own apparell: As S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal. 3. 27.</hi> ſaying, <hi>All yee that are baptized into</hi>

And this the faithfull Interperters plainly teſtifie, ſaying, <hi>Cum dicit Galatas Chriſtum induiſse, intelligit Chriſto ſic eſſe inſitos, ut coram Deo, &amp; nomen &amp; perſonam Chriſti gerant, ac in ipſo magis quam in ſeipſis cenſeantur:</hi> that is, Where as the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>Galathians</hi> have put on Chriſt, he meanes that they are ſo ingraffed into Chriſt, that before God they beare the name and perſon of Chriſt, and are reputed and eſtimated rather in him, than in themſelves.</p>

Which doctrine of the ancient Fathers of our wonderfull uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (although the Papiſts goe about to miſapply it, and ſay, this great work and union is wrought upon us, by the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, in that (ſay they) the bread becomes tranſubſtantiated into the body and blood of Chriſt; and ſo wee eating the ſame, the body of Chriſt is mingled and united into one body with us:) yet it is well proved of the Learned Proteſtants to bee utterly falſe. For the Sacrament is not the bond of this ſo myſticall and wonderſull union, after ſo groſſe, fleſhly, and carnall a manner; but it is wrought only by the holy Ghoſt, after a ſpirituall, and unſearchable manner. Who yet notwithſtanding, becauſe he is true God, <hi>&amp; hiîc exerit,</hi> and herein doth ſhew forth the power of his God-head,

               <p>Againe, in the ſame place, hee ſaith thus: <hi>Propterea ſemet ipſum nobis immiſcuit, &amp; ſuum in nos Corpus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperavit, ut unum quid efficiamur; tanquam Corpus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piti coaptatum; ardenter enim amantium hoc eſt,</hi> That is, For this cauſe, he hath mingled his own ſelfe into us, and hath tempered together his own body into us, that wee may be made one ſame thing with him, as the body is conjoyned with the head; for this is the manner of ſuch as love ardently.

But to embrace by faith this wonderfull union, is to be knit into the true Chriſt, who poures himſelfe ſo richly and abundantly into us, That perceiving and underſtanding how gloriouſly we are united, and made one with him, and how cloſe wee doe adhere and cleave by his ſpirit unto him, and ſeeing how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rich wee are made in him alone, freely, It is the powerfull meanes to make us to abhorre all other falſe Chriſts, and to cleave only to the true Chriſt, who hath by Juſtification by his blood, and by his ſpirit of Sanctification, eſo wonderfully knit us into his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, That he makes us happy and bleſſed only in his own ſelfe alone for ever, that we need not to hearken after any falſe Chriſt for more happineſſe any other way. Why? Becauſe to aſſure us, that hee doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate both himſelfe, and all his riches unto us, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates alſo unto us, his very name, <hi>That as a wife</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) <hi>is intitled with the name of her husband; ſo is the Church and true children of God, truly intitled with the name of her husband Chriſt.</hi> And again, (ſaith he) <hi>In hoc verò ſita eſt noſtra conſolatio, quod ſicut Chriſtus &amp; pater unum ſunt, ita &amp; nos cum eo unum ſumus, Vnde haec nominis communicatio (ita &amp; Chriſtus)</hi> that is, Herein conſiſteth our conſolation, that as Chriſt and his Father are one, ſo wee are one with him, from whence comes this communicating of name (ſo is Chriſt.) But the ſweetneſſe and comfort of this conſolatior conſiſteth herein. That as every one is married, by his true Juſtifying faith, particularly to Chriſt; ſo he muſt apply this union to his own ſelfe
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:192569:240"/> in particular, without which it becomes unfruitfull and unprofitable; yet not ſwarving hereby from the former doctrine, but a making of that which is generall to all, to bee thine own in particular, by applying it to thine own ſelfe in particular. Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I live not now:</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> belike is no <hi>Paul;</hi> but who lives then? <hi>Chriſt lives in me,</hi> that is, as <hi>Luther</hi> expounds it, <hi>I live not in mine onw perſon, nor in mine own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but Chriſt lives in me: Indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the perſon liveth, but not in himſelfe;</hi> and therefore he ſaith, <hi>I live not now, but Chriſt lives in me; Is eſt mea forma,</hi> Hee is my forme, <hi>more neerly joyned and united to me, than the colour or whitneſſe to the wall.</hi> Chriſt therefore (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> thus joyned and united unto mee, and abiding in me, liveth this life in me, which I now live. <hi>Now Chriſt living in me, I am dead to the Law,</hi> that is He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſheth the law to me, damneth ſin, deſtroyeth death: <note place="margin">At Chriſts preſence, the Law, ſinne and death, doe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away.</note> For it cannot bee, but at his preſence all theſe muſt needs vaniſh away; for Chriſt is everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, everlaſting Peace, Conſolation, and Life: and to theſe, ſin, the terror of the law, heavineſſe of minde, hell, and death, muſt needs give place. So Chriſt living, and abiding in me, taketh away, and ſwalloweth up all evills which vex and afflict mee. This union and conjunction then is the cauſe, that I am ſeparated from my ſelfe, and tranſlated into Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is a kingdome of grace, righteouſneſſe, peace, joy, life, ſalvation and glory; yea, by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable union and conjunction, which is through faith, Chriſt, and I, (mark this particularity, I) are made as it were one body in ſpirit. Hence it is, for this particular application of applying this cloſe union to our ſelves in particular, did <hi>Origen</hi> ſay, as we heard
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:192569:241"/> before, <hi>quod per unum Chriſtum fiunt multi Chriſti,</hi> that by one Chriſt, there are many Chriſts, becauſe they are transformed to the Image of him, who is the Image of God. But <hi>Luther</hi> upon <hi>Pauls</hi> foreſaid application, deſcribes the manner of this particular application with fuller demonſtration, ſaying thus: <hi>Quare fides purè eſt docenda, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore faith muſt be purely taught, namely that thou art ſo entirely and neerly joyned unto Chriſt, that he and thou are made, as it were, one perſon, which cannot be ſevered, but is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually joyned together; ſo that thou mayſt boldly ſay, <hi>Ego ſum Chriſtus,</hi> I am Chriſt, that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe, victory, and life are mine:</hi> And againe, Chriſt may ſay, <hi>Ego ſum ille peccator,</hi> I am that ſinner, that is, his ſinnes, and his death are mine; becauſe he is united and joyned unto me, and I unto him. For wee are ſo united together by the ſpirit, that wee are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one fleſh and one bone: For ſo ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Epheſ. 5. Wee are members of the body of Chriſt, of his</hi>

Indeed, I grant that thoſe groſſe and hardned wicked ones, which, as yet, have no touch of conſcience, ought with thoſe terrors as unruly ſervants, to be conſtrained to repentance; even as the Magiſtrate reſtraineth the wicked with the ſword: But where there is a touch and feeling of conſcience, there they are to be inſtructed, that firſt they begin at Chriſt, that truly believing and apprehending his rich mercy of <hi>Free Iuſtifying them,</hi> then may change their lives.

               <p>Thus where the Goſpel is truly in the heart, it makes <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> a man to be ſuch a one, as doth not look while the <note place="margin">Radineſſe to doe good.</note> Law commeth; but is ſo full of joy in Chriſt, that he is with ſpeed carried unto good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> doing well to all men, as much as he is able, and that of his owne accord, before the Law come into his minde.

               <p>For Chriſt firſt makes us righteous by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe in the holy Goſpel, and afterward he createth a new heart in us, bringeth forth new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and giveth unto us that aſſurance whereby we are perſwaded, that we pleaſe the father for his ſake: alſo he giveth unto us a true judgement, whereby wee prove and try thoſe things, which before we knew not, or elſe altogether diſliked.

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:192569:257"/> and if there lie a green ſtick or block that keepeth away the heat, yet put under more fire, and then it wil burne up the block, and make the water throughly hot. So our ſoule is this block, our affections are like to water, as cold to God as may be: but if we call unto peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Sanctification, zeale, and works, the fruits of the ſame, only with legall terrours, not putting under the fire of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> we ſhall either but little move them, or elſe, with a conſtrained ſanctity, make them worſe hypocrites, <hi>twofold more the children of hell, than they were before, Mat.</hi> 23. 15. but if we put under the <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 15.</note> fire of Chriſts love, in freely and gloriouſly juſtifying us, this burneth up all lets, and maketh us hot indeed, and zealous to good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note>

And this true meaning of the Law, and right underſtanding thereof, this revealing the infinite, pure, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nature of God, and the horrible filthineſſe of ſin, is to be diligently taught, and continually preached of all faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in every mixt Congregation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the beſt good workes of the moſt ſanctified children of God, as they (though moved thereunto by the holy Ghoſt) do them, are ſin, becauſe of their originall corruption, and by breaking the tenth Commandement in them; &amp; thereby they are ſo ſlaine, that is, truely humbled, by feeling themſelves, and all their beſt workes to be ſo ſhut up under ſin, that they daily bewail that they can performe no obedience, nor do any good worke before God in any of all his Commandements, as theſe and ſuch like Scriptures teach, <hi>Rom. 7. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18. 24. Galat. 3. 22. Rom. 4, 5. Phil. 3. 8. 4. Eſay 64. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the onely remedy to heale this our wofull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by ſinne (thus ſeen and felt to hang faſt upon us in this life) this only remedy is <hi>Free Juſtification,</hi> whereby God by the power of his ſonnes perfect righteouſneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 10. that all our ſins being utterly aboliſhed, not out of us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. 10. that there may be place for faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 1. Rom.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20. to 25. but yet truely aboliſhed form before God, or out of Gods ſight, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 22. Wee and all our workes are of unjuſt made juſt before God; that is, ſo perfectly and righteous from all ſpot of ſin in the ſight of God freely, that (as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Word of God teacheth, and the Proteſtant Writers abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie) God doth not, and, by reaſon of his actuall power, can ſee no ſinne in his juſtified children, freely (I ſay) by faith only, without workes, and our perfect workings. And I ſay by faith onely without workes, becauſe faith onely ſees this, and faith onely enjoyes this: and thus we and all our workes, both naturall workes, civill workes, or morall workes, and religious workes, are perfectly pure and cleane in Gods ſight, <hi>Acts 15. 8, 9. Titus</hi> 1. 15. and doe fully pleaſe, ſatisfie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God, becauſe we are fulfillers of the whole Law of God in
<pb facs="tcp:192569:263"/> his fight, for the righteouſneſſe of the Law is thus freely fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. Thus by Chriſts ſtripes we are healed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5. thus God, forgiving all our ſins, is ever well pleaſed, and at perfect peace with us; for, <hi>being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5. 1. and are freely made and adopted the ſons, and the daughters of the living God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 26. And thus are truely bleſſed; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. for, <hi>As many as are of faith, of</hi> Free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>are bleſſed with faithfull Abraham, Galat.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and ſhall be certainely glorified; for whom God juſtifieth, them alſo he glorifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. And thus we ſee how perfectly by Chriſts ſtripes we are healed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5. And all this Proteſtant Doctrine of <hi>Free Juſtification,</hi> and theſe two parts of the ſame, are cleerely and abundantly taught, by theſe and ſuch like Scriptures, <hi>Eſay 43. 25. Eſay 44. 22. 23. Iohn 1. 29. Heb. 1. 3. Heb. 9. 13. 14. 26. 1 Iohn 1. 7. Revel. 1, 5, 6. Dan. 9. 24. Rom. 3. 21, 22. Epheſ. 5. 26, 27. Rom. 5. 17, 18, 19, 21. Revel. 3. 18. Coloſ. 1. 22, 23.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that this true faith of <hi>Free Iuſtification</hi> (contrary to the judgement of Popiſh and carnall reaſon) unſeparably brings the holy Ghoſt to dwell in people, <hi>Galat. 3. 2. Acts 10. 44. Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. 52. which holy Ghoſt infallibly inflames our hearts with true love, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 6. and makes the true beleevers in right zeale of Gods glory, and in true thankfulneſſe, to break off from ſinne, and to mortifie, by true repentance, their former profane life, and ungodly converſation, and brings forth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative obedience, righteouſneſſe, and readineſſe to every good worke, now made good workes indeed freely, by <hi>Free Iuſtification;</hi> and ſo brings forth a ſincere, and though an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, yet a free and cheerfull walking in, and keeping of all Gods will and Commandements, declaratively to manward, which is true ſanctification. And thus is the Law not deſtroyed by <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> but eſtabliſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. and written in the hearts of true beleevers, and they are fulfillers and keepers of the Law, two manner of wayes; firſt, perfectly making their hearts perfectly righteous, freely, to the full content and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God by faith (as it was ſaid before) of <hi>Free Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> as theſe and ſuch like Scriptures teach, <hi>Rom. 10. 4, 5, 6, 10. Acts 15. 8, 9. Heb</hi> 8. 10. Secondly, it is written in their hearts,
<pb facs="tcp:192569:263"/> and they are fulfillers and keepers of the Law inchoatively, actively, and declaratively to manward by love and true ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as theſe Scriptures teach, <hi>Galat. 5. 13, 14. Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10. Yea, this true faith of <hi>Free Iuſtification,</hi> deeply, truely, and ſoundly learned, is a thing of perfect vertue, and wonderfull operation, ſtrength, and power to bring forth all good motions inwardly, and all good workes out wardly, or elſe it is not the true lively juſtifying faith, but the blinde dead faith, that leaves men in ſinne, death, and double damnation; as theſe and ſuch like Scriptures teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and 6. whole Chapters teach, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11. to 15. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. to 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6, whole Chapters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, whole Chapters, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 14. 17. to 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>5. That all ſuch Miniſters as doe not diligently teach, and cauſe people diligently to obſerve and keep this eſtabliſhed true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doctrine, but do deny, ſophiſticate, and wrangle againſt the ſame, muſt needs be like the falſe brethren amongſt the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians,</hi> in the dead faith, doting about queſtions, and making controverſies about the Law and works, and cannot but ſeduce the people from Chriſt; that is, from the ſimplicity of the faith that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to depend and hang for aſſurance of their ſalvation upon the Law and works, and cannot but be troublers of the Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7. and of peoples conſciences, diſtracting them into Popery, Arminianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Familiſme, Browniſme, and all manner of Sects and Schiſms, about works: becauſe by a carnall underſtanding of <hi>Free juſtification,</hi> they cannot but reſt in the light of reaſon, morall virtues, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature deſcribed <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. varniſhed and deceitfully gilt over with the titles of Grace, Graces, and Regeneration, Popiſhly and falſly underſtood, and other phraſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and being herein carryed with a blind, legall zeale, that they muſt and can keep, by their endevours, the law of God, the blind zealous multitude doe beare them record, and give them the applauſe that they have the zeale of God, but it is without knowledge; not but that they ſeeme to have all knowledge, ſave onely that they want the right knowledge, and true faith of <hi>Free juſtification:</hi> Becauſe <hi>being ignorant of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God,</hi> namely how complete it makes us before God, wanting nothing, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 10. they and their applauding Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
